only did Bishop's mathematics (BISH) have the advantage of readability — if you open Bishop's book at any page, what you see is clearly recognisable as analysis, even if, from time to time, his moves in the course of a proof may appear strange to one schooled in the use of the law of excluded middle — but, unlike intuitionistic or recursive mathematics, it admits many different interpretations. Intuitionistic mathematics, recursive constructive mathematics, and even classical mathematics all provide models of BISH. In fact, the results and proofs in BISH can be interpreted, with at most minor amendments, in any reasonable model of computable mathematics, such as, for example, Weihrauch's Type Two Effectivity Theory (Weihrauch 2000; Bauer 2005).
How is this multiple interpretability achieved? At least in part by Bishop's refusal to pin down his primitive notion of “algorithm” or, in his words, “finite routine”. This refusal has led to the criticism that his approach lacks the precision that a logician would normally expect of a foundational system. However, this criticism can be overcome by looking more closely at what practitioners of BISH actually do, as distinct from what Bishop may have thought he was doing, when they prove theorems: in practice, they are doing mathematics with intuitionistic logic. Experience shows that the restriction to intuitionistic logic always forces mathematicians to work in a manner that, at least informally, can be described as algorithmic; so algorithmic mathematics appears to be equivalent to mathematics that uses only intuitionistic logic. If that is the case, then we can practice constructive mathematics using intuitionistic logic on any reasonably defined mathematical objects, not just some class of “constructive objects”.
This view, more or less, appears to have first been put forward by Richman (1990, 1996). Taking the logic as the primary characteristic of constructive mathematics, it does not reflect the primacy of mathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer, Heyting, Markov, Bishop, and other pioneers of constructivism. On the other hand, it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in practice.
Thus one might distinguish between the ontological constructivism of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive mathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental creations, and the epistemological constructivism of Richman and those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its methodology, based on the use of intuitionistic logic. Of course, the former approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter; and the latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian ontology.

Of course, to do actual mathematics we need more than just intutionistic logic. For Bishop, the building blocks of mathematics were the positive integers (see the quote from Bishop 1967 in Section 3.1 above). Myhill (1975) gave an axiomatic foundation for BISH based on primitive notions of number, set, and function. Friedman (1977) dealt with intuitionistic ZF set theory, and Bridges (1987) worked with a highly formalised constructive Morse set theory. The two main formal underpinnings of BISH a this stage are the CZF set theory of Aczel and Rathjen (2000 and forthcoming), and the type theory of Martin-Löf (1975, 1984).

3.4 Martin-Löf's Constructive Type Theory
Before ending our tour of varieties of modern constructive mathematics, we visit a fourth variety, based on Per Martin-Löf's type-theory (ML). In 1968, Martin-Löf published his Notes on Constructive Mathematics, based on lectures he had given in Europe in 1966–68; so his involvement with constructivism in mathematics goes back at least to the period of Bishop's writing of Foundations of Constructive Analysis. Martin-Löf's book is in the spirit of RUSS, rather than BISH; indeed, its author did not have access to Bishop's book until his own manuscript was finished. Martin-Löf later turned his attention to his theory of types as a foundation for Bishop-style constructive mathematics.
Here, in his own words, is an informal explanation of the ideas underlying ML:
We shall think of mathematical objects or constructions. Every mathematical object is of a certain kind or type [… and] is always given together with its type. … A type is defined by describing what we have to do in order to construct an object of that type. … Put differently, a type is well-defined if we understand … what it means to be an object of that type. Thus, for instance N → N [functions from N to N] is a type, not because we know particular number theoretic functions like the primitive recursive ones, but because we think we understand the notion of number theoretic function in general. (Martin-Löf 1975)
In particular, in this system every proposition can be represented as a type: namely, the type of proofs of the proposition. Conversely, each type determines a proposition: namely, the proposition that the type in question is inhabited. So when we think of a certain type T as a proposition, we interpret the formula
x ∈ T
as “x is a proof of the proposition T”.
Martin-Löf goes on to construct new types, such as Cartesian products and disjoint unions, from old. For example, the Cartesian product
(Πx ∈ A) B(x)
is the type of functions that take an arbitrary object x of type A into an object of type B(x). In the propositions-as-proofs interpretation, where B(x) represents a proposition, the above Cartesian product corresponds to the universal proposition
(∀x ∈ A) B(x).
Martin-Löf distinguishes carefully between proofs and derivations: a proof object is a witness to the fact that some proposition has been proved; whereas a derivation is the record of the construction of a proof object. Also, he exercises two basic forms (one dare not say “types” here!) of judgement. The first is a relation between proof objects and propositions, the second a property of some propositions. In the first case, the judgement is either one that a proof object a is a witness to a proposition A, or else one that two proof objects a and b are equal and both witness that A has been proved. The first case of the second form of judgement states that a proposition A is well-formed, and the second records that two propositions A and B are equal.
There is a careful, and highly detailed, set of rules for formalising ML. We will not go into those here, but refer the reader to other sources such as Bridges & Reeves 1999. However, there is one further technical matter we would like to mention: the axiom of choice is derivable in ML.
The full axiom of choice can be stated as follows:
If A, B are inhabited sets, and S a subset of A × B such that
∀x∈A∃y∈B ((x, y) ∈ S),
(1)
then there exists a choice function ƒ : A → B such that
∀x∈A ((x, ƒ(x)) ∈ S).
Now, if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation, then for a given x ∈ A, the value ƒ(x) of the choice function will depend not only on x but also on the data proving that x belongs to A. In general, we cannot expect to produce a choice function of this sort. On the other hand, the BHK interpretation of (1) is that there is an algorithm A which, applied to any given x ∈ A, produces an element y ∈ B such that (x, y) ∈ S. If A is a completely presented (or, in Bishop's words, basic) set, one for which no work beyond the construction of each element in the set is required to prove that the element does indeed belong to A, then we might reasonably expect the algorithm A to be a choice function. In Bishop-style mathematics, basic sets are rare (N is one). In Martin-Löf's type theory, every set is completely presented and, in keeping with what we wrote above about the BHK interpretation of (1), the axiom of choice is derivable therein. In this connection, we should point the reader to the Diaconescu (1975), and Goodman and Myhill (1978), proofs that the axiom of choice entails the law of excluded middle (see also Problem 2 on page 58 of Bishop 1967). Clearly, the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem applies under the assumption that not every set is completely presented. For an analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type theory see Martin-Löf 2006.
When actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory, one often needs to equip completely presented sets (types) with an equivalence relation, the combination being known as a setoid. Mappings are then functions that respect those equivalence relations.This is in close agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory of sets. The dependent types of Martin-Löf are useful for constructing subsets. For instance, the real numbers can be constructed using the Σ-type (see Martin-Löf 1984):
(Σx ∈ N+→Q}(Πm ∈ N+)(Πn ∈ N+
