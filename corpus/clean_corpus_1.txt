Operationalism Operationalism is based on the intuition that we do not know the meaning of a concept unless we have a method of measurement for it It is commonly considered a theory of meaning which states that we mean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations the concept is synonymous with the corresponding set of operations Bridgman That drastic statement was made in The Logic of Modern Physics published in by the American physicist Bridgman The operationalist point of view first expounded at length in that book initially found many advocates among practicing physicists and those inspired by the tradition of American pragmatism or the new philosophy of logical positivism It is highly doubtful that Bridgman intended to advance a precise and universal theory of meaning or any systematic philosophical theory at all His writings were primarily reflections of a physicist rooted in experimental practice and aimed at articulating the scientific method from a first person point of view However as Bridgman ideas gained currency they were shaped into a general philosophical doctrine of operationalism or operationism and in that form became very influential in many areas especially in methodological debates in psychology Both in philosophy and in psychology operationalism is nowadays commonly regarded as an extreme and outmoded position but that is not to say that the potential of Bridgman original ideas has been exhausted This article has three sections each of which serves a different aim Section introduces Bridgman key ideas on operational analysis explaining their motivations and tracing the course of their development Section summarizes various critiques of operationalism which eventually led to a general philosophical consensus against it Section gives a view on the remaining potential of Bridgman ideas on operational analysis for philosophy of science today Percy Williams Bridgman was a physicist at Harvard University whose pioneering work in the physics of high pressures was rewarded with a Nobel Prize in His chief scientific contribution was made possible by technical prowess in his laboratory Bridgman created pressures nearly times higher than anyone else had achieved before him and investigated the novel behavior of various materials under such high pressures But Bridgman was placed in a predicament by his own achievements at such extreme pressures all previously known pressure gauges broke down how was he even to know what levels of pressure he had in fact reached see Kemble Birch and Holton As he kept breaking his own pressure records Bridgman had to establish a succession of new measures fit for higher and higher pressures Therefore it is no surprise that he thought seriously about the groundlessness of concepts where no methods were available for their measurement Another important stimulus to his philosophical thinking was his encounter with the revolutionary new physics of the early century Bridgman concerns about the definition and meaning of scientific concepts were forged in the general climate of shock suffered by physicists at that time from a barrage of phenomena and theoretical ideas that were entirely alien to everyday expectations culminating with quantum mechanics and its Copenhagen interpretation In a popular article Bridgman wrote if we sufficiently extend our range we shall find that nature is intrinsically and in its elements neither understandable nor subject to law Especially important for Bridgman thinking was Albert Einstein special theory of relativity Bridgman credited an unexpected teaching assignment in for his first real encounter with special relativity which gave him considerable distress as he tried to clarify the confusing conceptual situation surrounding the theory Bridgman in Frank At the heart of special relativity was Einstein recognition that judging the simultaneity of two events separated in space required a different operation from that required for judging the simultaneity of two events happening at the same place Fixing the latter operation was not sufficient to fix the former so a further convention was necessary which Einstein supplied in the form of his operation of sending light beams from each of the events in question to the midpoint between their locations to see if they arrive there at the same time How superior this way of thinking was compared to Isaac Newton declaration that he would not define Time Space Place or Motion as being well known to all quoted in Bridgman Bridgman felt that all physicists including himself had been guilty of unthinking extensions of concepts especially on the theoretical side of physics Bridgman sentiment arising out of these reflections however was not the familiar one of happy celebration of Einstein genius He rather regretted the sorry state of physics which had necessitated Einstein revolution Einstein showed what dangerous traps we could fall into by stepping into new domains with old concepts in an unreflective way Anyone thinking in operational terms would have recognized from the start that the meaning of distant simultaneity was not fixed unless an operation for judging it was specified Bridgman In Bridgman view Einstein revolution would never have been necessary if classical physicists had paid operational attention to what they were doing He thought that any future toppling of unsound structures would become unnecessary if the operational way of thinking could quietly prevent such unsound structures in the first place Operational awareness was required if physics was not to be caught off guard again as it had been in We must remain aware of these joints in our conceptual structure if we hope to render unnecessary the services of the unborn Einsteins Bridgman Bridgman impulse was to specify every possible detail of his operations because any detail could make an important difference Note the following passage inspired by the shock of learning from the special theory of relativity that the measured length of an object was not independent of its velocity Now suppose we have to measure a moving street car The simplest and what we may call the na√Øve procedure is to board the car with our meter stick and repeat the operations we would apply to a stationary body Notice that this procedure reduces to that already adopted in the limiting case when the velocity of the street car vanishes But here there may be new questions of detail How shall we jump on to the car with our stick in hand Shall we run and jump on from behind or shall we let it pick us up in front Or perhaps does now the material of which the stick is composed make a difference although previously it did not All these questions must be answered by experiment Bridgman emphasis added Bridgman found that the challenges of the unknown were amply present even in very prosaic circumstances Therefore he chose to open his discussion of operational analysis in The Logic of Modern Physics Bridgman with the example of the most mundane of all scientific concepts length He was both fascinated and troubled by the fact that essential physical limitations forced scientists to use different measurement operations for the same concept in different domains of phenomena Length is measured with a ruler only when we are dealing with dimensions that are comparable to our human bodies and when the objects of measurement are moving slowly relative to the measurer To measure say the distance to the moon we need to infer it from the amount of time that light takes to travel that distance and return and that is also the procedure taken up in Einstein theorizing in special relativity the space of astronomy is not a physical space of meter sticks but is a space of light waves Bridgman For even larger distances we use the unit of light year but we cannot actually use the operation of sending off a light beam to a distant speck of light in the sky and waiting for years on end until hopefully a reflected signal comes back to us or our descendants Much more complex reasoning and operations are required for measuring any distances beyond the solar system Thus at greater and greater distances not only does experimental accuracy become less but the very nature of the operations by which length is to be determined becomes indefinite To say that a certain star is light years distant is actually and conceptually an entire different kind of thing from saying that a certain goal post is meters distant Bridgman emphasis original Thus operational analysis reveals that length is not one homogeneous concept that applies in the whole range in which we use it In principle the operations by which length is measured should be uniquely specified If we have more than one set of operations we have more than one concept and strictly there should be a separate name to correspond to each different set of operations Bridgman emphases original In practice scientists did not recognize multiple concepts of length and Bridgman was willing to concede that it was allowable to use the same name to represent a series of concepts if the different measurement operations gave mutually consistent numerical results in the areas of overlap If we deal with phenomena outside the domain in which we originally defined our concepts we may find physical hindrances to performing the operations of the original definition so that the original operations have to be replaced by others These new operations are of course to be so chosen that they give within experimental error the same numerical results in the domain in which the two sets of operations may be both applied Bridgman However such numerical convergence between the results of two different operations was regarded by Bridgman as merely a practical justification for retaining the same name for what the two operations measured Bridgman Even in such convergent situations we have to be wary of the danger of slipping into conceptual confusion through the use of the same word to refer to the subjects of different operations If we do not temper our thoughts with the operationalist conscience always referring us back to concrete measurement operations we may get into the sloppy habit of using one word for all sorts of different situations without even checking for the required convergence in the overlapping domains Bridgman warned our verbal machinery has no built in cutoff Similarly we could be misled by the representation of a concept as a number into thinking that there is naturally an infinitely extendable scale for that concept since the real number line continues on to infinity in both directions It would also be easy to think that physical quantities must meaningfully exist down to infinite precision just because the numerical scale we have pinned on them is infinitely divisible Bridgman issued a stark reminder Mathematics does not recognize that as the physical range increases the fundamental concepts become hazy and eventually cease entirely to have physical meaning and therefore must be replaced by other concepts which are operationally quite different For instance the equations of motion make no distinction between the motion of a star into our galaxy from external space and the motion of an electron about the nucleus although physically the meaning in terms of operations of the quantities in the equations is entirely different in the two cases The structure of our mathematics is such that we are almost forced whether we want to or not to talk about the inside of an electron although physically we cannot assign any meaning to such statements Bridgman Bridgman thus emphasized that our concepts did not automatically extend beyond the domains in which they were originally defined He warned that concepts in far out domains could easily become meaningless for lack of applicable measurement operations The case of length in the very small scale makes that danger clear Beyond the resolution of the eye the ruler has to be given up in favor of various micrometers and microscopes When we get to the realm of atoms and elementary particles it is not clear what operations could be used to measure length and not even clear what length means any more After introducing operational analysis with that refreshing discussion of the length concept Bridgman published a long series of critical re assessments of various fundamental physical concepts His ruminations on length were extended into general commentary on the nature of space and the concept of time received a similar treatment His views on space and time were reminiscent of Henri Poincar√© and Pierre Duhem Bridgman noted that clocks had to be used in the empirical determination of the basic laws of physics but our confidence that a clock ticks regularly was founded in the basic laws of physics governing its mechanism Suppose we are trying to test the general theory of relativity by measuring the red shift of light coming out of a heavy body If the vibrating atom is a clock then the light of the sun is shifted toward the infra red but how do we know that the atom is a clock some say yes others no If we find the displacement physically have we thereby proved that general relativity is physically true or have we proved that the atom is a clock or have we merely proved that there is a particular kind of connection between the atom and the rest of nature leaving the possibility open that neither is the atom a clock nor general relativity true Bridgman Bridgman found these reflections liberating as well as troubling Basic space time concepts are not uniquely determined a priori For example he noted that the definition of velocity shared in classical mechanics and special relativity was not the only one in line with our intuitions of what velocity meant Consider this alternative a traveler in an automobile measures his velocity by observing the clock on his instrument board and the mile stones which he passes on the road If we adopt such a procedure we will find that the speed of light is infinite if special relativity is correct about time dilation with the car going at the speed of light according to an observer standing on the road the clock on the car will not advance at all while the car passes any number of milestones This alternative concept of velocity would have the advantage that there would be no limit to the velocity which can be imparted to material bodies on giving them unlimited energy which seems intuitively natural and simple But assigning an infinite velocity to light is also most unnatural particularly if we favor a medium point of view So there was a dilemma all sorts of phenomena cannot at the same time be treated simply Bridgman In the latter parts of The Logic of Modern Physics Bridgman gave a fascinating array of discussions on the concepts of force mass energy light field and more generally the theories of thermodynamics relativity and quantum mechanics These thoughts were developed further in the remaining decades of his life and collected in subsequent volumes including The Nature of Physical Theory The Nature of Thermodynamics Reflections of a Physicist second edition The Nature of Some of Our Physical Concepts and The Way Things Are Bridgman made a searching examination of the familiar concepts of classical physics checking to see if they retained operational meaning in domains of phenomena that were unfamiliar to the creators of classical physics In some cases his analysis showed that the classical concepts were operationally unsound even in the contexts in which they were originally created Later in life he stated that his initial foray into philosophy was motivated by his disquietude about physics especially electrodynamics and thermodynamics in which the fundamental understanding of even the acknowledged leaders in physics were inadequate Bridgman In contrast he thought that on the whole the contemporary development of quantum theory went in the right direction especially in Werner Heisenberg version of it which discarded classical concepts where they did not apply space time orbits for electrons and crafted new concepts with clear operational meaning in new domains of phenomena However he was not entirely satisfied with Niels Bohr doctrine that all the operations of physics needed to be explained in the macroscopic language of daily life or of present day philosophy rather he thought we needed to develop a more adequate macroscopic language Interestingly Bridgman never stopped thinking about relativity The operationalist lesson he had taken from Einstein was so dear to him that he did not shrink from criticizing Einstein himself when the latter seemed to betray his own principles in the general theory of relativity Already in The Logic of Modern Physics he had opined I personally question whether the elements of Einstein formulation such as curvature of space time are closely enough connected with immediate physical experience ever to be accepted as an ultimate in a scheme of explanation and I very much feel the need for a formulation in more intimate physical terms Years later when Bridgman was invited by A Schilpp to contribute to the Library of Living Philosophers volume on Einstein he issued the following indictment against Einstein he has carried into general relativity theory precisely that uncritical pre Einsteinian point of view which he has so convincingly shown us in his special theory conceals the possibility of disaster Bridgman in Schilpp reprinted in Bridgman Einstein brushed aside Bridgman objection merely stating that for a formal system to qualify as a physical theory it was not necessary to demand that all of its assertions can be independently interpreted and tested operationally Einstein in Schilpp This exchange is reminiscent of the one that Heisenberg reported in which Einstein responded with bemused incomprehension to Heisenberg protest that he was following a lesson from Einstein in treating only directly observable quantities in his matrix mechanics Heisenberg Bridgman also carried out further operational analysis of special relativity and his late thoughts on the subject were published posthumously in A Sophisticate Primer on Relativity Bridgman critique of concepts in physics also led naturally to a philosophical critique of some general conceptions underlying physics such as simplicity atomism causality determinism and probability He also gave critical considerations to mathematics and its application to the physical world There was no stone Bridgman was willing to leave unturned in his relentless critique He went as far as to declare arithmetic so far as it purports to deal with actual physical objects is also affected with the same penumbra of uncertainty as all other empirical science Bridgman Among physicists Bridgman reflections found a strong echo especially in the early days Perhaps that was natural it has been said by Bridgman himself too that operationalism arose from observing physicists in action Bridgman in Frank Gerald Holton recalls what an electrifying experience it was for himself and many other physicists to read The Logic of Modern Physics for the first time The explanation Holton gives of the immense power of Bridgman work is not that the work brings to the reader a message never thought of before but that it lays open with clarity what the reader has been trying to formulate on his or her own Bridgman also extended his operationalist thinking by considering its implications outside physics This was important to him at least from the time of The Logic of Modern Physics in which he ventured many of the questions asked about social and philosophical subjects will be found to be meaningless when examined from the point of operations It would doubtless conduce greatly to clarity of thought if the operational mode of thinking were adopted in all fields of inquiry as well as in the physical To Bridgman it was clear that to adopt the operational point of view means a far reaching change in all our habits of thought He knew that in practice this would be a very difficult thing to do Operational thinking will at first prove to be an unsocial virtue one will find oneself perpetually unable to understand the simplest conversation of one friends and will make oneself universally unpopular by demanding the meaning of apparently the simplest terms of every argument Perhaps this throwaway remark was a sign of things to come as Bridgman would in the end find himself rather isolated and plagued by misunderstanding even among those who found his philosophical ideas worth discussing as we will see in Section Bridgman did not develop in detail his operationalist ideas in relation to any other science than physics apparently content to leave that job to the specialists in the respective fields Some others did take up Bridgman call for operationalist reformulations of their fields with interesting consequences It could be said that operationalism did not change the practice of physics itself much from what it already was and the physicists followed him only as far as he asserted what was common sense to them Matters were different in other sciences that paid attention to Bridgman and that was most significant and pronounced in the case of psychology Behaviorist psychologists took up operationalism or operationism as it was more often called in psychology as a weapon in their fight against more traditional psychologists especially those who prized introspection as the most important source of psychological knowledge The Harvard psychologist Edwin Boring saw Bridgman philosophy as a modern substitute for positivism and he seems to have coined the term operationism see Walter It was Boring student Stanley Smith Stevens who was perhaps the most aggressive promoter of operationism in psychology Hardcastle Feest Stevens saw operationism as a sure method of increasing rigor in psychological experiments and discourse asserting that to experience is for the purpose of science to react discriminately since these reactions are what science can measure and record publically quoted in Feest Echoing Bridgman take on Einstein Stevens declared in The revolution that will put an end to the possibility of revolutions is the one that defines a straightforward procedure for the definition and validation of concepts Such a procedure is the one which tests the meaning of concepts by appealing to the concrete operations by which the concept is determined We may call it operationism quoted in Walter In his concrete research in psychology Stevens focused on psychophysics starting with his Ph dissertation on the perceived attributes of tones written under Boring supervision Another notable operationist in psychology was Edward Chace Tolman also a Harvard Ph who taught for most of his life at the University of California at Berkeley Starting with his research on problem solving behavior in rats Tolman gave an operational treatment of desire for example operationalizing hunger in terms of time since last feeding Tolman did not deny that desire was a subjective feeling but insisted that doing scientific research on it required experimentally tractable operations that would allow scientists to get a hold on something related to that subjective experience see Feest In Gustav Bergmann assessment operationism helped behaviorism to move from its initial metaphysical Watsonian variety to its modern version Bergmann in Frank Despite the strong popularity of operationist behaviorism in certain quarters it never commanded a complete consensus even in American psychology Perhaps the most unexpected opposition came from Bridgman himself Behaviorists were wanting to use operations to attain objectivity in psychology which for them meant taking psychological discourse away from attempts to describe private experience This was just the wrong move in Bridgman view as we will see in more detail in Section below Bridgman engaged in some discussion with Stevens but discovered that the latter enthusiasm for operational ideas was really for something that he could not agree with By he declared privately I have rather washed my hands of him quoted in Walter Bridgman disagreement with Skinner was even more severe and resulted in a prolonged dispute between the two Holton Walter Operationism became a subject of great controversy in psychology epitomized in a special issue of the Psychological Review devoted to a symposium on operationism suggested by Boring who remained supportive of the movement at some critical distance To some limited extent this debate still continues in psychology see Feest Despite the initial popularity of Bridgman ideas by the middle of the century the common reactions among philosophers and philosophically minded scientists were strongly critical Operationalism received many high profile debates among them a symposium held at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS in published in Frank and the Psychological Review issue mentioned above On such occasions Bridgman attempted to refine and defend his views but also found that the debate was moving in directions that both surprised and disturbed him In his contribution to the AAAS symposium he exclaimed There would seem to be no reason why I am better fitted than anyone else to open this discussion As I listened to the papers I felt that I have only a historical connection with this thing called operationalism In short I feel that I have created a Frankenstein which has certainly got away from me I abhor the word operationalism or operationism which seems to imply a dogma or at least a thesis of some kind The thing I have envisaged is too simple to be dignified by so pretentious a name Bridgman in Frank Still arguably it was not Bridgman own ideas about operational analysis but the Frankenstein of operationalism that had a more significant impact in philosophy and science so this survey of operationalism must deal with how other people responded to operationalism as they saw it In the course of the discussion I will try to point out some places where there were clear misunderstandings of Bridgman ideas and also other places where Bridgman himself was ambivalent or ambiguous rather than simply misunderstood Given the timing and contexts of the publication of Bridgman ideas the philosophical debates surrounding them were to a large extent framed in relation to logical positivism which was just making its big impact on the American philosophical scene In fact no less than Herbert Feigl came to Harvard with the express purpose of learning from Bridgman despite the latter warning that he did not have much to teach Walter Bridgman insistence on operational meaningfulness had at least a surface resemblance to the logical positivists verification theory of meaning Bergmann thought Bridgman had given a scientist version of the latter Bergmann in Frank and Carl Hempel regarded operationalism and logical positivism as closely akin to each other Hempel in Frank And it is not difficult to see how a kindred philosophical doctrine coming from a world class scientist would have captured the logical positivists imagination When subjected to the scrutiny of professional philosophers however Bridgman ideas were soon exposed as unsystematic and undeveloped as he freely admitted himself Moreover it became evident that his ideas did not help logical positivists solve the key problems that they were struggling with After the initial fascination the standard positivist and post positivist reaction to operationalism was disappointment and operationalism was often seen as a failed philosophy that did not live up to its promises Nowhere was the positivist disappointment with Bridgman sharper than in considerations of operationalism as a theory of meaning There was a set of objections which together amounted to a complaint that operational definitions did not give a sufficient account of the meaning of concepts even where there were operations clearly relevant to the concepts in question The core of the problem here is an overly restrictive notion of meaning which reduces it to measurement I will call this Bridgman reductive doctrine of meaning Although Bridgman was not proposing a general philosophical theory of meaning he did make remarks that revealed an impulse to do so Consider the following statement the last part of which I have already quoted We evidently know what we mean by length if we can tell what the length of any and every object is and for the physicist nothing more is required To find the length of an object we have to perform certain physical operations The concept of length is therefore fixed when the operations by which length is measured are fixed that is the concept of length involves as much as and nothing more than the set of operations by which length is determined In general we mean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations the concept is synonymous with the corresponding set of operations Bridgman Similarly he also displayed an impulse to use operations to make a criterion of meaningfulness If a specific question has meaning it must be possible to find operations by which an answer may be given to it Bridgman One lesson we can take from Bridgman troubles is that meaning is unruly and promiscuous The kind of absolute control on the meaning of scientific concepts that Bridgman wished for is not possible The most control that can be achieved is for the scientific community to agree on an explicit definition and to respect it But even firm definitions can only constrain the uses of a concept The entire world can agree to define length by the standard meter in Paris or by the wavelength of a certain atomic radiation and that still comes nowhere near exhausting all that we mean by length Bridgman himself later specifically admitted that his statement that meanings were synonymous with operations was obviously going too far when taken out of context Especially compared with the notion of meaning as use often traced back to the later phase of Ludwig Wittgenstein work it is easy to recognize the narrowness of Bridgman initial ideas Bridgman later gloss on his ideas was in fact rather late Wittgensteinian To know the meaning of a term used by me it is evident I think that I must know the conditions under which I would use the term Since measurement operations provide only one specific context in which a concept is used operational definitions can only cover one particular aspect of meaning Recognizing the restrictiveness of Bridgman early remarks on meaning gives us a useful framework for understanding one common objection to operationalism As Donald Gillies emphasizes if we accept the most extreme kind of operationalism there is no point in asking whether a measurement method is valid if the measurement method defines the concept and there is nothing more to the meaning of the concept the measurement method is automatically valid as a matter of convention or even tautology Metrological validity becomes an interesting question only if the concept possesses a broader meaning than the specification of the method of its measurement Then the measurement method can be said to be valid if it coheres with the other aspects of the concept meaning That way we may also make a judgment about whether an operational definition or any other kind of definition is an appropriate one depending on how well it coheres with other elements of the concept meaning and how beneficially it controls other elements of meaning So far I have noted that an operational definition is not sufficient to express a concept meaning fully Going further than that many critics of operationalism have argued that not every good scientific concept needs to have an operational definition If operationalism means demanding that every concept and every inferential step should have an immediate operational significance it constitutes an overly restrictive empiricism At times Bridgman did appear to be making such a demand as illustrated in the poignant episode discussed in Section above in which he criticized Einstein for betraying his own operationalist lesson in the general theory of relativity Einstein view was that there was no reason for physicists to shrink from using a non operational concept if that delivered good results Einstein was self consciously opportunistic in his methodological eclecticism but philosophers wanted to find a more general rationale for freeing scientific theorizing from operationalist micro management The crux of the problem here for the operationalist is that theoretical concepts are much too useful in science Bridgman actually acknowledged from early on that there were good theoretical concepts that were not amenable to direct operationalization illustrating the point with the example of stress and strain inside a solid body and the wavefunction in quantum mechanics Bridgman in Frank Bridgman saw clearly that these theoretical concepts only had indirect connections with physical operations but he did not see any problems with that He in fact went so far as to say there need be no qualms that the operational point of view will ever place the slightest restriction on the freedom of the theoretical physicist to explore the consequences of any free mental construction Bridgman in Frank All that was required was that the theoretical system touched the operational ground somewhere eventually However in that case Bridgman message was the same as Einstein as the physicist Lindsay pointed out Lindsay in Frank Bridgman position on the matter of theoretical concepts was complicated and perhaps not entirely self consistent I will return to this point in Section One common objection to operationalism is based on a misunderstanding that reveals an essential difference between Bridgman and most of his critics It is often said that operationalism cannot be right because each scientific concept can be measured in various ways This criticism is based on the presumption that the concept in question has unity which means that its definition must also be unified If there are a variety of measurement methods all of which apply to one concept then measurement methods cannot be what supplies the unified definition instead some theoretical account must be given as to how the variety of operations under consideration serve to measure the same thing Bridgman in contrast had no such presumption of conceptual unity For him the initial position to take was that if there are different methods of measurement we have different concepts as he said about tactual and optical length being two different concepts Now it could be that there is one aspect of reality that different measurement operations all get at but that is something to be demonstrated not to be assumed at the outset The possibility of unity can be entertained if the minimum condition of numerical convergence is met that is if two measurement operations have an overlapping range and their results agree in the overlap Still Bridgman maintained some skepticism about whether it was safe for us to infer real conceptual unity from such numerical convergence Bridgman ambivalence about conceptual unity elicited a serious worry about the systematic import of scientific concepts and theories most astutely expressed by Hempel Bridgman skeptical caution would result in an intolerable fragmentation of science Hempel argued It would result in a proliferation of concepts of length of temperature and of all other scientific concepts that would not only be practically unmanageable but theoretically endless Hempel worry was that Bridgman quest for safety was blinding him to one of the ultimate aims of science namely the attainment of a simple systematically unified account of empirical phenomena Hempel Along similar lines Lindsay had earlier argued that such an isolation of concepts would defeat the very aim of physical science which is to provide a simple and economical description of physical experience in terms of a minimum number of concepts Bridgman had serious doubts about the plausibility of such a simple unified account of nature as I will explain further in Section But Hempel and others could genuinely envisage it Hempel noted that with the development of science there was a continually growing and thickening network of nomic threads linking various knot concepts with each other as further empirical laws were discovered Hempel argued that it was essential to keep this thickening conceptual network systematic and simple to that end concept formation and theory formation must go hand in hand Hempel That in turn often necessitated a modification of the operational criteria originally adopted for some of the central concepts Hempel Operationalism would stand in the way of such flexibility Apart from the questions of whether operational definitions are sufficient or necessary it is actually unclear what types of things operations are and how they should be specified The surface level intuition is simple the operations that matter are measurement operations involving physical instruments But from the start Bridgman also stated that the operations which fixed meaning were mental if the concepts in question were mental in mathematics And he knew that measurement operations involved more than physical manipulations of instruments at least there are recordings and computations involved in the processing and analysis of data and there are mental acts linking various parts of that complex procedure too To take the simplest example the operation of counting is a mental operation but it is an integral part of many physical procedures He called such crucial non physical operations paper and pencil operations Bridgman lamented that it was the most wide spread misconception with regard to the operational technique to think that it demanded that all concepts in physics must find their meaning only in terms of physical operations in the laboratory Bridgman also Bridgman Later he gave a rough classification of operations into the instrumental mental verbal and paper and pencil varieties Bridgman This issue becomes sharper when we ask the question of purpose what are the aims of operational analysis and which operations are suitable for achieving those aims Having distinguished various types of operations Bridgman also had to deal with the question of whether different types had different epistemic values going beyond his initial intuitive fondness for instrumental operations For example if the point of operationalizing a concept was to make its meaning clear and precise which meant using operations which can be unequivocally performed Bridgman then why were paper and pencil operations such as the construction of Euclidean geometric figures not just as good as instrumental operations In the end he was willing to dispense with any ultimate privileging of instrumental operations But he still maintained a preference for them when possible without giving a convincing reason for that preference Bridgman Thus Bridgman position on the nature and function of operations was uneasy from start to finish Various critics rightly zeroed in on this point The most important point of contention was whether and why physical or instrumental operations had any special epistemic advantage The Yale physicist Henry Margenau put the point succinctly Operationalism is an attitude that emphasizes the need of recourse wherever feasible to instrumental procedures when meanings are to be established Bridgman disavows its status as a philosophy and wisely so for as a general view it cannot define the meaning of instrumental procedure in a manner that saves the view from being either trivial which would be true if instrumental were construed to include symbolic mental and paper and pencil operations or too restrictive if all operations are to be laboratory procedures Margenau in Frank As one can imagine this dilemma also hampered attempts to use operational analysis in psychology Operations in psychological research inevitably involved verbal instructions reports and reactions It was difficult to argue that these mental or verbal operations were superior in reliability or meaningfulness to the introspective reporting of mental states which operationists tried so hard to exclude from scientific psychology Bridgman himself was troubled by the question regarding the nature of operations and admitted late in his life that he had not really provided an analysis of what it is that makes an operation suitable or in what terms can operations be specified Bridgman in Frank An even deeper pessimism was expressed in Bridgman year retrospective on The Logic of Modern Physics commissioned for Daedalus by Holton To me now it seems incomprehensible that I should ever have thought it within my powers to analyze so thoroughly the functioning of our thinking apparatus that I could confidently expect to exhaust the subject and eliminate the possibility of a bright new idea against which I would be defenseless Bridgman One last issue needs to be mentioned before I complete the discussion of the critique of operationalism the privacy of operations This is perhaps not widely remembered now but it was the issue on which Bridgman position elicited the most severe incomprehension and objection even from many who called themselves operationalists The emblematic moment in this dispute came during the International Congress for the Unity of Science in held at Harvard University one of the highpoints of the activities of the Vienna Circle in exile in America see Holton Bridgman was invited to address this conference and chose to give a talk entitled Science Public or Private At this point it became clear that his enterprise was fundamentally at odds with the logical positivist project despite the surface kinship The process that I want to call scientific is a process that involves the continual apprehension of meaning the constant appraisal of significance accompanied by a running act of checking to be sure that I am doing what I want to do and of judging correctness or incorrectness This checking and judging and accepting that together constitute understanding are done by me and can be done for me by no one else They are as private as my toothache and without them science is dead Bridgman Positivists and behaviorists had embraced operationalism for precisely the opposite reason they thought operations were public objective and verifiable unlike private experience But Bridgman was insistent that operations were a matter for private experience He could see no warrant in simply taking someone else testimony as true or reliable or in regarding the report of an operation performed by someone else as the same kind of thing as an operation performed and experienced by himself In a later paper called New Vistas for Intelligence he declared Science is not truly objective unless it recognizes its own subjective or individual aspects Bridgman As Holton puts it Bridgman drive in operational analysis was to throw the spotlight on performable action above all an action performed by himself Ultimately he was a private man so much so that he was accused of solipsism to which he scarcely objected In his epistemic individualism Bridgman was perhaps only matched by Herbert Dingle among notable century philosophers of science see Dingle Bridgman individualistic bent both in epistemology and social life was in stark contrast to the logical positivist vision of knowledge and society particularly the strand of positivism driven by Otto Neurath The latter aversion to the private compelled him to express even first hand observation reports as third person happenings in space and time of the following type Otto protocol at clock Otto speech thinking at clock was at clock there was a table in the room perceived by Otto Neurath Bridgman was unyielding in his opposition to Neurath type of objectification of personal experience To him operations provided the best possible refuge from the ocean of uncertainty always threatening to engulf science and the relative certainty was only possible if he was learning from his own operations not from second hand reports from some other person In this regard Bridgman was closer to the strand of logical positivism represented by Moritz Schlick who insisted on maintaining the notion of direct experience as the final arbiter of knowledge Schlick admitted that experience was fleeting and only provided momentary points of verification rather than any lasting foundation one could build knowledge on Bridgman operations had more promise in this regard as the operations were meant to be repeatable so the descriptions of operations and their results would be lasting However that was not to be such a straightforward matter as we will see in Section As Holton reports from his first hand observations of Bridgman the privacy of operations and the consequent privacy of science was not an idle philosophical doctrine In the lab he carried out as much of the work as possible with his own hands using few assistants and crafting most of his instruments himself Holton quotes the following report as typical of the way Bridgman worked It is easy if all precautions are observed to drill a hole inches long in from to hours that is a hole as narrow as the lead in a pencil in a block of very hard steel In academic life Bridgman openly lamented the intellectual fashion of emphasizing that all our activities are fundamentally social in nature As for his social and political writings they were often agonizing attempts to clarify for himself the place of the intelligent individual in society He was unabashedly elitist both on behalf of the gifted individual and of scientists as a group and argued that giving appropriate special treatment to scientists would in the end benefit society that is all the individuals in society Maila Walter observes Within the community of scientists and scientific philosophers Bridgman had become the lone spokesman for a radical existential subjectivism more akin to Rheinhold Niebuhr existentialist theology than to any commonly recognized philosophy of science Bridgman uncompromising individualism continued right to the end with a self administered euthanasia in the late stage of a painful terminal illness see Holton Is operationalism only a historical curiosity In this final section I would like to give a synoptic view of the relevance of operationalism to some issues that are current in philosophy of science As already noted Bridgman ideas first gained recognition in the midst of the logical positivist preoccupation with language and meaning therefore operationalism was taken primarily as a doctrine about meaning and as such shown to be inadequate In that context it was reasonable for most philosophers to abandon it Bridgman made various attempts to get beyond the popular caricature of operationalism adopted by advocates and critics alike These attempts never received sufficient attention but they offer some valuable lessons and show many productive directions in which his views can be interpreted and extended It is useful to continue listening to his retrospective given in the AAAS conference quoted earlier Bridgman tells us that what he advocated was merely an attitude or point of view generated by continued practice of operational analysis So far as any dogma is involved here at all it is merely the conviction that it is better because it takes us further to analyze into doings or happenings rather than into objects or entities Bridgman in Frank Already in his paper on Operational Analysis Bridgman had stated that in the attempt to understand how science works the subject matter is activity of one sort or another He equated activity and operations the term operation only accentuating the directedness of the activity in question In his last general philosophical treatise The Way Things Are Bridgman came back to this theme and stated that an operational analysis was only a particular case of an analysis in terms of activities doings or happenings instead of analysis in terms of objects or static abstractions or in terms of things or static elements also If we take our inspiration from this later Bridgman we can take him as a guide for a new practice oriented philosophy of science We can put aside his reductive doctrine of meaning his puritanical search for certainty and his ambivalent privileging of instrumental operations over other types of operations What Bridgman started up but never quite accomplished in a systematic and complete way was a philosophical analysis of science in terms of activities Operations provide the philosopher and the historian of science with a very useful unit of analysis actions or events as opposed to objects statements beliefs theories paradigms research programs etc The concept of operation should provide an effective framework for incorporating certain highly valuable insights about the nature of scientific practice including the ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein on language games Michael Polanyi on tacit knowledge Marjorie Grene on the knowing agent and Ian Hacking on direct interventions in experimental investigations In order to develop Bridgman operational analysis into a full fledged philosophy of scientific practice there are some aspects of his thought that we need to develop and articulate further First of all we need a clearer and more detailed taxonomy of operations without trying to say which types are better or worse at the outset From this point of view it should not be regarded as a problem or an annoyance that there are different types of operations The categories offered by Bridgman are much too broad so we need to identify and describe specific and concrete operations and distinguish simple and elementary ones from more complex ones For example the operation of length measurement with a meter stick would be analyzable into the instrumental operations of alignment and concatenation the perceptual operation of judging spatial coincidence and the mental operation of counting The operation of hypothesis testing in the received view would be analyzable into the simpler operations of deductive prediction experimental observation and the comparison between deduced and observed outcomes In the understanding of these operations we would need a detailed account of the scientist as the agent who performs the operations here we return to Bridgman preoccupation with the free individual but also in essential social interaction with other individuals A full understanding of operations would require an understanding of the agent purposes partly based on the fundamental aims of science assumptions including metaphysical principles essential for the particular type of activity in question and skills and capabilities including the tacit dimension If we can achieve such a thick description of the operations that constitute scientific practice we would be able to make good on Bridgman promise that it is better because it takes us further to analyze into doings or happenings rather than into objects or entities Above I have presented a new operationalism as a promising framework for the analysis of scientific practice Do Bridgman ideas and attitudes also hold any current relevance for scientific practice itself He did intend to reform scientific practice itself not just its second order analysis so we must ask whether his reformist agenda has anything left in it for current science To the casual reader much of Bridgman writing will seem like a series of radical complaints about the meaninglessness of various concepts and statements But he was not interested in skeptical critique as an idle philosophical exercise He got most worried when a concept was being extended to new situations where the familiar operations defining the concept ceased to be applicable His arguments often had an iconoclastic flavor because he was exceptionally good at recognizing where a concept had been extended to new domains unthinkingly and most people were not even aware that the extension had been made From the methodological lesson he took from Einstein to the insights gained in his own high pressure physics an important focus of Bridgman operationalism was on regulating the extension of concepts to uncharted domains Bridgman reminded us forcefully that measurement operations did not have unlimited domains of application and that our conceptual structures consequently had joints at which operational meanings changed But there can be no joints if there is no continuous tissue around the disjointed bones Less metaphorically if we reduce meaning entirely to measurement operations there are no possible grounds for assuming or demanding any continuity of meaning where there is clear discontinuity in measurement operations When we have two different operations which give convergent results in the overlapping domain how do we tell whether what we have is an accidental convergence of the measured values of two unrelated quantities or a unified concept measured by two different methods Some critics have maintained that only a recourse to theories can give us the answer Lindsay Gillies That does not seem to me always necessary as theory is not the only source of semantic continuity There are instrumental operations that are not metrological and these operations can provide a continuity of meaning against which metrological validity can be judged see Section We can take operationalism as a useful and practicable caution not to make conceptual extensions without operational grounds A homespun example from the century illustrates this point nicely the efforts of the English potter Josiah Wedgwood to extend the temperature scale to cover the very high temperatures in his kilns at which mercury vaporized and glass melted All previously known thermometers failed in that pyrometric range so Wedgwood felt obliged to invent a whole new measurement standard reminiscent of Bridgman in his high pressure laboratory Wedgwood noticed that very high temperatures made pieces of clay shrink and created a temperature scale by assuming that the amount of contraction was proportional to temperature beyond red heat As the start of his scale red heat defined as was already beyond the boiling point of mercury Wedgwood scale was wholly disconnected from the temperature scale defined by mercury thermometers Later in response to widespread demand to clarify the meaning of his scale in more usual terms Wedgwood made a translation of his scale into Fahrenheit degrees by means of an intermediate standard thermal expansion of silver which overlapped with the high end of the mercury scale and the low end of the clay scale This process produced some unlikely numbers for example for the temperature of his air furnace It seems that Wedgwood initially did exactly what operationalist conscience would dictate as the new instrument did not operate at all in the range of any trustworthy previous thermometers he made a fresh scale Why was that not the honest thing to do and quite sufficient too Why did everyone including Wedgwood himself feel compelled to interpret the Wedgwood clay scale in terms of the mercury Fahrenheit scale Why was a continuous extension desired so strongly when a disjointed set of operations seemed to serve all necessary practical purposes The urge for conceptual extension in the Wedgwood case was rooted in a widespread feeling that there was a property in the pyrometric range that was continuous in its meaning with temperature in the everyday range Where did that feeling come from long before there was any well defined and agreed upon theoretical concept of temperature If we look closely at the situation numerous subtle and often unspoken connections do emerge between pyrometric temperature and everyday temperature In the first place we do bring objects to pyrometric domains by prolonged heating that is to say by a prolonged application of ordinary processes that cause the rise of temperature within the everyday domain Likewise the same causes of cooling that operate in the everyday domain will bring objects from pyrometric temperatures down to everyday temperatures that is precisely what happens in calorimetric pyrometry or when we simply leave very hot things out in cold air for a while These concrete physical operations provide a continuity of operational meaning between two domains that are not connected by a common measurement standard Here again we need to articulate something that Bridgman already did imply not all instrumental operations are measurement operations as such for instance we may know how to make iron melt without thereby obtaining any precise idea of the temperature at which that happens Operational meaning even in the narrow instrumental sense is broader than meaning specified by methods of measurement The connections listed above rest on very basic qualitative causal assumptions about temperature fire raises the temperature of any ordinary objects on which it acts directly if two objects at different temperatures are put in contact with each other their temperatures tend to approach each other There are semi quantitative links as well It is taken for granted that the consumption of more fuel should result in the generation of more heat and that is partly based on a primitive notion of energy conservation It is assumed that the amount of heat communicated to an object is roughly proportional to the amount of change in its temperature barring changes of state and interfering influences and that assumption is based on the rough but robust understanding of temperature as the degree of heat So for example when a crucible is put on a steady fire one assumes that the temperature of its contents will rise steadily up to a certain maximum That is exactly the kind of reasoning used by the chemist John Frederic Daniell to criticize some of Wedgwood results Now any body almost knows how very soon silver melts after it has attained a bright red heat and every practical chemist has observed it to his cost when working with silver crucibles Neither the consumption of fuel nor the increase of the air draught necessary to produce this effect can warrant us in supposing that the fusing point of silver is times higher than a red heat fully visible in day light Neither on the same grounds is it possible to admit that a full red heat being and the welding heat of iron that the fusing point of cast iron can be more than higher The welding of iron must surely be considered as incipient fusion quoted in Chang Similar types of rough assumptions were also used in the extension of temperature to very low temperatures beyond the freezing point of mercury and alcohol These cases illustrate that concepts can and do get extended to fresh new domains in which theories are uncertain and experience scant even if no definite measurement operations have been worked out We start with a concept with a secure net of uses giving it stable meaning in a restricted domain of circumstances The extension of such a concept consists in giving it a secure net of uses also credibly linked to the earlier net in an adjacent domain Such extension can happen in all kinds of ways including theoretical fiat and metaphysical presumption but the operational method is the most assured one Specific well defined operations whether they be instrumental mental or paper and pencil type can start a secure skeleton of meaning in the new domain With all the elements of new meaning operationally well defined it also becomes possible to attempt linking them up with each other at each step along the way and check the whole meaning for coherence Compare such a deliberate process with the vague presumption that terms in a theoretical equation must have the same meaning in the entire mathematical range given to the variables Operationalism in this guise can be used as a secure method of conceptual extension not prone to the kind of fragmentation that Hempel feared Such operationalism would not destroy systematic unity on the contrary it is an optimal strategy for achieving as much systematic unity as nature would allow in a strongly empiricist system of knowledge Conceptual extension is important especially since it served as one of the key initial motivations of Bridgman thought but it is only part of the operationalist story In more general terms operationalism can be seen as a strategy for increasing the empirical content of scientific theories Empirical content is not something we hear about very much these days in philosophy of science after the receding of Popperian and Lakatosian doctrines but for Bridgman it was one of the key issues If we take operationalism as a commitment to increase empirical content Bridgman was not so much a high handed judge who pronounced upon the meaningfulness of concepts in a black and white manner Rather he offered operational analysis as a tool of self diagnosis and self improvement He was interested in advancing science not in carping against it like Descartes he used skepticism as a means of achieving a more positive end The operationalist dictum could be phrased as follows maintain and increase the empirical content of theories by the use of operationally well defined concepts What is empirical content Karl Popper saw the amount of the empirical content of a theory as the number of states of the world that are forbidden by it Regarding laws of nature he said the more they prohibit they more they say Popper Or somewhat more formally I define the empirical content of a statement as the class of its potential falsifiers Similarly but staying away from the strict falsificationist idiom Imre Lakatos understood empirical content as the number of empirically testable predictions It is difficult to craft an exact quantitative measure but we can at least say that the amount of empirical content depends on the number of empirically testable relations that a theory specifies That in turn depends on the number of independently measurable parameters Increasing the latter or at least maintaining it was something that Bridgman sought to achieve with his operationalism This I submit was one of the key reasons why he did not like conceptual extensions that were not backed up by measurement operations in the new domain To follow Bridgman thinking along these lines consider this intriguing passage which at first glance looks like another complaint about meaninglessness But towards the end the main point emerges as a worry about diminishing empirical content What is the possible meaning of the statement that the diameter of an electron is cm Again the only answer is found by examining the operations by which the number was obtained This number came by solving certain equations derived from the field equations of electrodynamics into which certain numerical data obtained by experiment had been substituted The concept of length has therefore now been so modified as to include that theory of electricity embodied in the field equations and most important assumes the correctness of extending these equations from the dimensions in which they may be verified experimentally into a region in which their correctness is one of the most important and problematical of present day questions in physics To find whether the field equations are correct on a small scale we must verify the relations demanded by the equations between the electric and magnetic forces and the space co√∂rdinates to determine which involves measurement of lengths But if these space co√∂rdinates cannot be given an independent meaning apart from the equations not only is the attempted verification of the equations impossible but the question itself is meaningless If we stick to the concept of length by itself we are landed in a vicious circle As a matter of fact the concept of length disappears as an independent thing and fuses in a complicated way with other concepts all of which are themselves altered thereby with the result that the total number of concepts used in describing nature at this level is reduced in number Bridgman Such a reduction in the number of operationally meaningful concepts is almost bound to result in a corresponding reduction in the number of relations that can be tested empirically A good scientist would fight against such a reduction of empirical content This concern with empirical content also explains why Bridgman was not content with the mainstream post positivist philosophical discourse on concept formation and empirical significance exemplified by the works of Carl Hempel and Willard Van Orman Quine As noted in Section Bridgman did not object to theoretical science creating a system of concepts and laws that made contact with observations only at some points However Quinean holism in which the unit of empirical significance was the entire system of knowledge had no particular concern about increasing the number of those points of contact with experience Bridgman ideal was to operationalize each and every concept if possible and each case of de operationalization rang alarm bells in his head Recognizing the importance of empirical content helps us make sense of Bridgman complex attitude toward theoretical concepts In a little known section of The Logic of Modern Physics he discussed what he called mental constructs in science particularly those created in order to enable us to deal with physical situations which we cannot directly experience through our senses but with which we have contact indirectly and by inference Not all constructs are the same The essential point is that our constructs fall into two classes those to which no physical operations correspond other than those which enter the definition of the construct and those which admit of other operations or which could be defined in several alternative ways in terms of physically distinct operations This difference in the character of constructs may be expected to correspond to essential physical differences and these physical differences are much too likely to be overlooked in the thinking of physicists Bridgman They were also very easily overlooked in the thinking of philosophers who debated his ideas What Bridgman says here is entirely contrary to the common image of his doctrines When it came to constructs of which physics is full Bridgman not only admitted that one concept could correspond to many different operations but even suggested that such multiplicity of operational meaning was what we mean by the reality of things not given directly by experience In an illustration of these ideas Bridgman argued that the concept of stress within a solid body had physical reality but the concept of electric field did not since the latter only ever manifested itself through force and electric charge by which it was defined Bridgman This comes down to the stance that a theoretical concept without direct operational meaning is worthwhile only if it serves as a mediator connecting two or more operationally meaningful concepts creating an empirically testable relation This is in fact not so different from Hempel view quoted in Section albeit with a different emphasis In closing I would like to pull out an insight from Bridgman that is usually not recognized in discussions of operationalism but actually has emerged as a significant point of contention in more recent philosophy of science This is the issue of complexity In Section I have already quoted Bridgman puzzling statement that nature is ultimately neither understandable nor subject to law As it turns out that was not an isolated off hand remark An important aspect of Bridgman operationalism was a search for certainty and it was a search made all the more desperate by a deep rooted pessimism about the possibility of attaining any certainty in science at least if scientists were to seek a simple and unified system of knowledge Bridgman professed his belief that the external world of objects and happenings is so complex that all aspects of it can never be reproduced by any verbal structure He lamented Even in physics this is not sufficiently appreciated as is shown for example by the reification of energy The totality of situations covered by various aspects of the energy concept is too complex to be reproduced by any simple verbal device Bridgman in Frank Bridgman view on the complexity of nature also had a direct implication for the limits of operational analysis itself in providing clarity and precision Right from The Logic of Modern Physics Bridgman stressed that all results of measurement are only approximate this obvious fact he said tacitly underlies all our discussion This he attributed ultimately to something fundamental about the nature of human experience all experience seems to be of this character we never have perfectly clean cut knowledge of anything but all our experience is surrounded by a twilight zone a penumbra of uncertainty into which we have not yet penetrated This penumbra is as truly an unexplored region as any other region beyond experiment This indicated a fundamental limitation to the certainty of operations Operations themselves are of course derived from experience and would be expected also to have a nebulous edge of uncertainty Bridgman remained clearly aware of the complexities revealed by operational analysis stating late in his life that operational analysis can always be pushed to the point where sharpness disappears Bridgman in Frank and that there is nothing absolute or final about an operational analysis Bridgman Still he would not give up on the pushing which was necessary to reach as much clarity as possible History Problems and Issues Traditional epistemology has its roots in Plato and the ancient skeptics One strand emerges from Plato interest in the problem of distinguishing between knowledge and true belief His solution was to suggest that knowledge differs from true belief in being justified Ancient skeptics complained that all attempts to provide any such justification were hopelessly flawed Another strand emerges from the attempt to provide a reconstruction of human knowledge showing how the pieces of human knowledge fit together in a structure of mutual support This project got its modern stamp from Descartes and comes in empiricist as well as rationalist versions which in turn can be given either a foundational or coherentist twist The two strands are woven together by a common theme The bonds that hold the reconstruction of human knowledge together are the justificational and evidential relations which enable us to distinguish knowledge from true belief The traditional approach is predicated on the assumption that epistemological questions have to be answered in ways which do not presuppose any particular knowledge The argument is that any such appeal would obviously be question begging Such approaches may be appropriately labeled transcendental The Darwinian revolution of the nineteenth century suggested an alternative approach first explored by Dewey and the pragmatists Human beings as the products of evolutionary development are natural beings Their capacities for knowledge and belief are also the products of a natural evolutionary development As such there is some reason to suspect that knowing as a natural activity could and should be treated and analyzed along lines compatible with its status by the methods of natural science On this view there is no sharp division of labor between science and epistemology In particular the results of particular sciences such as evolutionary biology and psychology are not ruled a priori irrelevant to the solution of epistemological problems Such approaches in general are called naturalistic epistemologies whether they are directly motivated by evolutionary considerations or not Those which are directly motivated by evolutionary considerations and which argue that the growth of knowledge follows the pattern of evolution in biology are called evolutionary epistemologies Evolutionary epistemology is the attempt to address questions in the theory of knowledge from an evolutionary point of view Evolutionary epistemology involves in part deploying models and metaphors drawn from evolutionary biology in the attempt to characterize and resolve issues arising in epistemology and conceptual change As disciplines co evolve models are traded back and forth Thus evolutionary epistemology also involves attempts to understand how biological evolution proceeds by interpreting it through models drawn from our understanding of conceptual change and the development of theories The term evolutionary epistemology was coined by Donald Campbell The Evolution of Epistemological Mechanisms EEM versus The Evolutionary Epistemology of Theories EET There are two interrelated but distinct programs which go by the name evolutionary epistemology One focuses on the development of cognitive mechanisms in animals and humans This involves a straightforward extension of the biological theory of evolution to those aspects or traits of animals which are the biological substrates of cognitive activity their brains sensory systems motor systems etc The other program attempts to account for the evolution of ideas scientific theories epistemic norms and culture in general by using models and metaphors drawn from evolutionary biology Both programs have their roots in century biology and social philosophy in the work of Darwin Spencer James and others There have been a number of attempts in the intervening years to develop the programs in detail see Campbell Bradie Cziko Much of the contemporary work in evolutionary epistemology derives from the work of Konrad Lorenz Donald Campbell et al Karl Popper and Stephen Toulmin The two programs have been labeled EEM and EET Bradie EEM is the label for the program which attempts to provide an evolutionary account of the development of cognitive structures EET is the label for the program which attempts to analyze the development of human knowledge and epistemological norms by appealing to relevant biological considerations Some of these attempts involve analyzing the growth of human knowledge in terms of selectionist models and metaphors Popper Toulmin Hull see Renzi and Napolitano for a critique of these efforts Others argue for a biological grounding of epistemological norms and methodologies but eschew selectionist models of the growth of human knowledge as such Ruse Rescher The EEM and EET programs are interconnected but distinct A successful EEM selectionist explanation of the development of cognitive brain structures provides no warrant in itself for extrapolating such models to understand the development of human knowledge systems Similarly endorsing an EET selectionist account of how human knowledge systems grow does not in itself warrant concluding that specific or general brain structures involved in cognition are the result of natural selection for enhanced cognitive capacities The two programs though similar in design and drawing upon the same models and metaphors do not stand or fall together Ontogeny versus Phylogeny Biological development involves both ontogenetic and phylogenetic considerations Thus the development of specific traits such as the opposable thumb in humans can be viewed both from the point of view of the development of that trait in individual organisms ontogeny and the development of that trait in the human lineage phylogeny The development of knowledge and knowing mechanisms exhibits a parallel distinction We can consider the growth of an individual corpus of knowledge and epistemological norms or his or her brain ontogeny or the growth of human knowledge and establishment of epistemological norms across generations or the development of brains in the human lineage phylogeny The EEM EET distinction cuts across this distinction since we may be concerned either with the ontogenetic or phylogenetic development of the brain or the ontogenetic or phylogenetic development of norms and knowledge corpora One might expect that since current orthodoxy maintains that biological processes of ontogenesis proceed differently from the selectionist processes of phylogenesis evolutionary epistemologies would reflect this difference Curiously enough however for the most part they do not For example the theory of neural Darwinism as put forth by Edelman and Changeaux offers a selectionist account of the ontogenetic development of the neural structures of the brain Karl Popper conjectures and refutations model of the development of human knowledge is a well known example of a selectionist account which has been applied both to the ontogenetic growth of knowledge in individuals as well as the trans generational phylogenetic evolution of scientific knowledge Skinner theory of operant conditioning which deals with the ontogenesis of individual behavior is explicitly based upon the Darwinian selectionist model Skinner A third distinction concerns descriptive versus prescriptive approaches to epistemology and the growth of human knowledge Traditionally epistemology has been construed as a normative project whose aim is to clarify and defend conceptions of knowledge foundations evidential warrant and justification Many have argued that neither the EEM programs nor the EET programs have anything at all to do with epistemology properly traditionally understood The basis for this contention is that epistemology properly understood is a normative discipline whereas the EEM and EET programs are concerned with the construction of causal and genetic descriptive models of the evolution of cognitive capacities or knowledge systems No such models it is alleged can have anything important to contribute to normative epistemology Kim The force of this complaint depends upon how one construes the relationship between evolutionary epistemology and the tradition There are three possible configurations of the relationship between descriptive and traditional epistemologies Descriptive epistemologies can be construed as competitors to traditional normative epistemologies On this view both are trying to address the same concerns and offering competing solutions Riedl defends this position A standard objection to such approaches is that descriptive accounts are not adequate to do justice to the prescriptive elements of normative methodologies The extent to which an evolutionary approach contributes to the resolution of traditional epistemological and philosophical problems is a function of which approach one adopts cf Dretske Bradie Ruse Radnitsky and Bartley Kim Descriptive epistemology might be seen as a successor discipline to traditional epistemology On this reading descriptive epistemology does not address the questions of traditional epistemology because it deems them irrelevant or unanswerable or uninteresting Many defenders of naturalized epistemologies fall into this camp Munz Descriptive epistemology might be seen as complementary to traditional epistemology This appears to be Campbell view On this analysis the function of the evolutionary approach is to provide a descriptive account of knowing mechanisms while leaving the prescriptive aspects of epistemology to more traditional approaches At best the evolutionary analyses serve to rule out normative approaches which are either implausible or inconsistent with an evolutionary origin of human understanding Future Prospects EEM programs are saddled with the typical uncertainties of phylogenetic reconstructions Is this or that organ or structure an adaptation and if so for what In addition there are the uncertainties which result from the necessarily sparse fossil record of brain and sensory organ development The EET programs are even more problematic While it is plausible enough to think that the evolutionary imprint on our organs of thought influences what and how we do think it is not at all clear that the influence is direct significant or detectible Selectionist epistemologies which endorse a trial and error methodology as an appropriate model for understanding scientific change are not analytic consequences of accepting that the brain and other ancillary organs are adaptations which have evolved primarily under the influence of natural selection The viability of such selectionist models is an empirical question which rests on the development of adequate models Hull is as he himself admits but the first step in that direction Cziko is a manifesto urging the development of such models cf also the evolutionary game theory modeling approach of Harms Much hard empirical work needs to be done to sustain this line of research Non selectionist evolutionary epistemologies along the lines of Ruse face a different range of difficulties It remains to be shown that any biological considerations are sufficiently restrictive to narrow down the range of potential methodologies in any meaningful way Nevertheless the emergence in the latter quarter of the twentieth century of serious efforts to provide an evolutionary account of human understanding has potentially radical consequences The application of selectionist models to the development of human knowledge for example creates an immediate tension Standard traditional accounts of the emergence and growth of scientific knowledge see science as a progressive enterprise which under the appropriate conditions of rational and free inquiry generates a body of knowledge which progressively converges on the truth Selectionist models of biological evolution on the other hand are generally construed to be non progressive or at most locally so Rather than generating convergence biological evolution produces diversity Popper evolutionary epistemology attempts to embrace both but does so uneasily Kuhn scientific revolutions account draws tentatively upon a Darwinian model but when criticized Kuhn retreated cf Kuhn pp with Lakatos and Musgrave Toulmin is a noteworthy exception On his account concepts of rationality are purely local and are themselves subject to evolution This in turn seems to entail the need to abandon any sense of goal directedness in scientific inquiry This is a radical consequence which few have embraced Pursuing an evolutionary approach to epistemology raises fundamental questions about the concepts of knowledge truth realism justification and rationality Expanding the Circle Although Campbell and Popper both pointed to the continuity between the evolution of human knowledge and the evolution of knowledge in non human organisms much of the early work in evolutionary epistemology focused on the human condition However recent empirical investigations by psychologists cognitive ethologists cognitive neuroscientists and animal behaviorists have revealed that animals both primates and non primates have much more sophisticated cognitive capacities than were previously suspected Panksepp Heyes and Huber Rogers and Kaplan From an evolutionary perspective this is not surprising given the shared evolutionary heritage that all animals share Taking Darwin seriously means reconsidering and reassessing the nature of human knowledge in the light of our increased awareness of the cogntive capabilities of the members of other species In addition once a firm empirical basis of the scope and limits of animal cognitive capacities has been established we will be in a position to reassess our philosophical evaluations of the mental lives of animals and their epistemic and moral status as well Further field research promises to revolutionize our understanding of the sense in which human beings are one among the animals The KLI Theory Lab of the Konrad Lorenz Institute in Vienna offers an extensive bio and bibliographical data base covering eighteen research areas related to evolution and cognition research The entry for evolutionary epistemology contains links to authors and texts as well as a brief introduction and overview of the field It is an interactive database and the Institute encourages authors to submit their own relevant bibliographies for inclusion in the database The database can be accessed at http theorylab org In addition there is a journal devoted to issues in evolutionary epistemology in addition to other applications of biological theory Biological Theory Integrating Development Evolution and Cognition Information about the journal can be found at http www kli ac at journal Formal Models Every scientific enterprise requires formal and semi formal models which allow the quantitative characterization of its objects of study The attempt to transform the philosophical study of knowledge into a scientific discipline which approaches knowledge as a biological phenomenon is no different Much of the evolutionary epistemology literature has been concerned with how to conceive of knowledge as a natural phenomenon what difference this would make to our understanding of our place in the world and with answering objections to the project There are as well a number of more technical projects which attempt to provide the theoretical tools necessary for a naturalistic epistemology Static Optimization Models In the simplest sort of model an organism has to deal with an environment that has two states and and has two possible responses and We suppose that what the organism does in each state makes a difference to its fitness Fitnesses are usually written characterized by a matrix The individual elements of the matrix Wij are the fitness consequences of response in state So for instance denotes the fitness consequences of in If we let and equal one and and equal zero then there is a clear evolutionary advantage to performing in and in However the organism must first detect the state of the environment and detectors are not in general perfectly reliable If the organism responds automatically to the detector we can use the probabilities of responses given states to characterize the reliability of the detector We write the probability of given as Pr This allows us to calculate that responding to the detector rather than always choosing or will be advantageous just in case the following inequality holds cf Godfrey Smith Pr Pr Pr Pr This simple model demonstrates that whether or not flexible responses are adaptive depends on the particular characteristics of the fitness differences that the responses make the probability of the various states of the environment and the reliability of the detector The particular result is calculated assuming that detecting the environmental state and the flexible response system is free in evolutionary terms More complete analyses would include the costs of these factors Static optimization models like the one outlined above can be extended in several ways Most obviously the number of environmental states and organismic responses can be increased but there are other modifications that are more interesting Signal detection theory for instance models the detectors and cues in more detail In one example a species of sea moss detects the presence of predatory sea slugs via a chemical cue They respond by growing spines which is costly The cue in this case the water borne chemical comes in a variety of concentrations which indicate various levels of danger Signal detection theory allows us to calculate the best threshold value of the detector for the growing of spines Static models depict evolutionary processes in terms of fitness costs and benefits They are static in the sense that they model no actual process but merely calculate the direction of change for different situations If fitness is high a type will increase if low it will decrease When fitnesses are equal population proportions remain at stable equilibrium Dynamic models typically employ the kinds of calculations involved in static models to depict actual change over time in population proportions Instead of calculating whether change will occur and in what direction dynamic models follow change Population Dynamics Population dynamics sometimes referred to as replicator dynamics offers a tractable way to model the evolution of populations over time under the kinds of selective pressures that can be characterized by static optimization models This is often necessary since the dynamics of such populations are often difficult to predict purely on the basis of static considerations of payoff differences The so called replicator dynamics were named by Taylor and Jonker and generalized by Schuster and Sigmund and Hofbauer and Sigmund They trace their source back to the seminal work of A Fisher in the and The generalization covers evolutionary models used in population genetics evolutionary game theory ecology and the study of prebiotic evolution The models can be implemented either mathematically or computationally and can model either stepwise discrete or continuous evolutionary change Population dynamics models the evolution of populations A population is a collection of individuals which are categorized according to type The types in genetics are genes in evolutionary game theory strategies The types of interest in epistemological models would be types of cognitive apparatuses or cognitive strategies ways of responding to environmental cues ways of manipulating representations and so forth Roughly EEM models focus on the inherited and EET models focus on the learned The evolution of the population consists in changes of the relative frequency of the different types within the population Selection typified by differential reproductive success is represented as follows Each type has a growth rate or fitness designated by and a frequency designated by The frequency of type at the next generation pi is simply the old frequency multiplied by the fitness and divided by the mean fitness of the population Division by has the effect of normalizing the frequencies so that they add up to one after each is multiplied by its fitness It also makes evident that the frequency of a type will increase just in case its fitness is higher than the current population average Fitness Fitnesses which should be understood simply as the aggregation of probable growth factors that drive the dynamics of large populations may depend on a variety of factors Fitness components differ from variation components in that they affect population frequencies proportionally to those frequencies that is to say multiplicatively Fitness component in biological evolution include mortality and reproductive rate In cultural evolution they include transmission probability and rejection probability Within either sort of model what matters is how fitnesses change as a result of other changing factors within the model In the simplest cases fitnesses are fixed and the type with the highest fitness inevitably dominates the population In more complex cases fitnesses may depend on variable factors like who one plays against or the state of a variable environment Most commonly variable fitnesses are calculated using a payoff matrix like the one above In general to calculate the expected fitness of a type one multiplies the fitness a type would have in each situation times the likelihood that individuals in the population will confront that situation and adds the resulting products wi SA Pr A WiA where WiA is type fitness in situation A This sort of calculation assumes that the effects of the various situations are additive More complex situations can be modeled of course but additive matrices are the standard It should be noted however that matrix driven evolution can exhibit quite complex behavior For instance chaotic behavior is possible with as few as four strategies Skyrms Some relationships may be represented without a matrix Boyd and Richerson for instance were interested in a special kind of frequency dependent transmission bias in culture where being common conferred an advantage due to imitators doing as the Romans do In such a case the operative fitness of the type is just the fitness as calculated according to the usual factors and then modified as a function of the frequency of the type Continuity and Computation The conceptual bases of replicator dynamics are quite straightforward Getting results typically requires one of two approaches In order to prove more than rudimentary mathematical results one typically needs to derive a continuous version of the dynamics The basic form is dpi dt wi with fitnesses calculated as usual Mathematical approaches have been quite productive though the bulk of theoretical results apply primarily to population genetics See Hofbauer and Sigmund for a compendium of such results as well as a reasonable graduate level introduction to the mathematical study of evolutionary processes The second approach is computational With the increase in power of personal computers computational implementation of evolutionary models become increasingly attractive They require only rudimentary programming skills and are in general much more flexible in the assumptions they require The general strategy is to create an array to hold population frequencies and fitnesses and then a series of procedures or methods or functions which calculate fitnesses update frequencies with the new fitnesses and manage interface details like outputting the new state of the population to a file or the screen A loop then runs the routines in sequence over and over again Most modelers are happy to put their source code on the internet which is probably the best place to find it Modeling Cultural Evolution Part of the difficulty in understanding cognitive behavior as the product of evolution is that there are at least three very different evolutionary processes involved First there is the biological evolution of cognitive and perceptual mechanisms via genetic inheritance Second there is the cultural evolution of languages and concepts Third there is the trial and error learning process that occurs during an individual lifetime Moreover there is some reason to agree with Donald Campbell that understanding human knowledge fully will require understanding the interaction between these processes This requires that we be able to model both processes of biological and cultural evolution There are by now a number of well established models of biological evolution Cultural evolution presents more novelty Perhaps the most popular attempt to understand cultural evolution is Richard Dawkins invention of the meme Dawkins observed that what lies at the heart of biological evolution is differential reproduction Evolution in general was then the competitive dynamics of lineages of self replicating entities If culture was to evolve on this view there had to be cultural replicators or entities whose differential replication in culture constituted the cultural evolutionary process Dawkins dubbed these entities memes and they were characterized as informational entities which infect our brains leaping from head to head via what we ordinarily call imitation Common examples include infectious tunes and religious ideologies The main difficulty with this approach has been with providing specifications for the basic entities The identity conditions of genes can be given in theory in terms of sequences of base pairs in chromosomes There appears to be no such fundamental alphabet for the items of cultural transmission Consequently the project of memetics as contending basis for evolutionary epistemology is on hold pending an adequate understanding of its basic ontology See the online Journal of Memetics for more information Population models have been used to good effect in modeling cultural transmission processes Evolutionary game theory models are frequently claimed to cover both processes in which strategies are inherited and those in which they are imitated This application is possible in the absence of any specification of the underlying nature of strategies for instance whether they are to be thought of as things which are replicated or whether they are properties or states of the individuals whose strategies they are This is sometimes referred to as the epidemiological approach though again the comparison to infection is due to the quantitative tools used in analysis rather than to any presupposition regarding the underlying ontology of cultural transmission Multi Level Evolution The kind of levels involved in evolutionary epistemology are quite different than the kind of levels of selection which are discussed much more often in the levels of selection debate in evolutionary biology In evolutionary biology the levels of selection under discussion are levels of scale The debate concerns whether genes are always the units or targets of selection or whether selection can occur on higher levels like organisms groups and species The levels involved in evolutionary epistemology on the other hand are levels of the regulatory hierarchy involved in the control of behavior These include the genetic bases of cognitive and perceptual hardware concepts languages techniques beliefs preferences and so forth Note that in the case of evolutionary epistemology the terms levels and hierarchy may be impressionistic There is often no clear arrangement of levels at all There are at least two different approaches that have been taken to modeling multi level evolution Dual Transmission Models Boyd and Richerson adapted models from genetics to model a case in which a trait cooperation was affected both by genetic and cultural evolution It was first shown that a genetically determined bias on cultural transmission could be selected for in a migratory population The bias made it easier to pick up local customs increasing the likelihood of imitation beyond that determined by the frequency and perceived value of the behavior Once this bias was in place its effect was strong enough to overcome the perceived costs involved in cooperative behavior The model yielded two important results First it provided a novel mechanism according to which cooperative behavior can stabilize in migratory populations But more importantly it demonstrated that cultural evolution cannot be predicted purely on the basis of genetic fitnesses Multiple Population Models Harms constructed a multi level dynamic population model of bumblebee learning Mutual information between distributions of sensor types overt foraging behaviors and internal foraging preferences on the one hand and environmental states on the other was assessed and compared to average fitness of the population states It was shown that information present in overt behaviors may be underutilized and that exaptation of sensor mechanisms for preference formation can bring about the utilization of that information Meaning Full descriptive accounts of truth and justification both demand a theory of meaning Until a sign has meaning it cannot be true or false Moreover determining the meaning of justificatory claims may provide a descriptive theory of justification Presumably what makes a claim of justification true is the basis of that justification If meaning is conventional then the evolution of meaning becomes an instance of the evolution of conventions Models of the evolution of conventions have in one case been extended to apply to meaning conventions Skyrms chapter gave an evolutionary interpretation of David Lewis model of rational selection of meaning conventions Skyrms was able to show that there is strong selection on the formation of signaling systems in mixed populations with a full set of coordinated countercoordinated and uncoordinated strategies It is significant that the structure of the model and the selective process by which meaning conventions emerge and are stabilized largely parallels the account of the evolution of meaning given by Ruth Millikan In the simplest version the model is constructed as follows We imagine that there are two states of affairs two acts A and two signals Players have an equal chance of being in either the position of sender or receiver Receivers must decide what to do based purely on what the sender tells them In this purely cooperative version each player gets one point if the receiver does if the state is or if the state is Since players will be both sender and receiver they must have a strategy for each situation There are sixteen such strategies and we suppose them to be either inherited or learned from biological parents or imitated on the basis of perceived success in terms of points earned Strategies and are signaling systems in that if both players play the same one of these two strategies they will always get their payoff and are anti signaling strategies which result in consistent miscoordination though they do well against each other All of the other strategies involve or which results in the same act being performed no matter what the external state is Sender Strategies Receiver Strategies Complete Strategies Simulation results showed that virtually all initial population distributions become dominated by one or the other of the two signaling system strategies The situation becomes more complex when more realistic payoffs are introduced for instance that the sender incurs a cost rather than automatically sharing the benefit that the receiver gets from correct behavior for the environment Even in such situations however the most likely course of evolution is domination by a signaling system Academic Tools Other Internet Resources Related Entries Generating the Problem of Moral Luck and Kinds of Luck The idea that morality is immune from luck finds inspiration in Kant A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes because of its fitness to attain some proposed end but only because of its volition that is it is good in itself Even if by a special disfavor of fortune or by the niggardly provision of a step motherly nature this will should wholly lack the capacity to carry out its purpose if with its greatest efforts it should yet achieve nothing and only the good will were left not of course as a mere wish but as the summoning of all means insofar as they are in our control then like a jewel it would still shine by itself as something that has its full worth in itself Usefulness or fruitlessness can neither add anything to this worth nor take anything away from it Kant Thomas Nagel approvingly cites this passage in the opening of his article Moral Luck Nagel article began as a reply to Williams paper of the same name and the two articles together articulated in a new and powerful way a challenge for anyone wishing to defend the Kantian idea that morality is immune from luck To see exactly how the challenge arises let us begin with the Control Principle CP We are morally assessable only to the extent that what we are assessed for depends on factors under our control It is intuitively compelling as is the following corollary of it CP Corollary Two people ought not to be morally assessed differently if the only other differences between them are due to factors beyond their control Not only are the Control Principle and its corollary plausible in themselves they also seem to find support in our reactions to particular cases For example if we find out that a woman who has just stepped on your toes was simply pushed then our temptation to blame her is likely to evaporate It seems that the reason for this is our unwillingness to hold someone responsible for what is not in her control Similarly if two drivers have taken all precautions and are abiding by all the rules of the road and in one case a dog runs in front of the car and is killed and not in the other then given that the dog running out was not something over which either driver had control it seems that we are reluctant to blame one driver more than the other Although we might expect different reactions from the two drivers it does not seem that one is deserving of a worse moral assessment than the other At the same time it seems that there are countless cases in which the objects of our moral assessments do depend on factors beyond agents control Even though moral luck seems to be an oxymoron everyday judgments suggest that there is a phenomenon of moral luck after all As Nagel defines it Where a significant aspect of what someone does depends on factors beyond his control yet we continue to treat him in that respect as an object of moral judgment it can be called moral luck Nagel To bring out the conflict with the Control Principle even more starkly we will understand moral luck as follows ML moral luck occurs when an agent can be correctly treated as an object of moral judgment despite the fact that a significant aspect of what he is assessed for depends on factors beyond his control We certainly seem to be committed to the existence of moral luck For example we seem to blame those who have murdered more than we blame those who have merely attempted murder even if the reason for the lack of success in the second case is that the intended victim unexpectedly tripped and fell to the floor just as the bullet arrived at head height Since whether the intended victim tripped or not is not something in control of either would be murderer we appear to violate the Control Principle and its corollary It might be tempting to respond at this point that what people are really responsible for are their intentions or their willings and that we are thus wrong to offer different moral assessments in this pair of cases Adam Smith for example advocates this position writing that To the intention or affection of the heart therefore to the propriety and impropriety to the beneficence or hurtfulness of the design all praise or blame all approbation or disapprobation of any kind which can justly be bestowed upon any action must ultimately belong II iii intro But this tempting response faces difficulties of its own First as we will see the would be murderers offer only one of many cases in which our intuitive moral judgment appears to depend on results beyond one intentions as Smith himself noted II iii intro And even more importantly luck can affect even our willings and other internal states Feinberg As Nagel develops the point there are other types of luck that affect not only our actions but also every intention we form and every exertion of our wills Further once these kinds of luck are recognized we will see that not one of the factors on which agents actions depend is immune to luck Nagel identifies four kinds of luck in all resultant circumstantial constitutive and causal Resultant Luck Resultant luck is luck in the way things turn out Examples include the pair of would be murderers just mentioned as well as the pair of innocent drivers described above In both cases each member of the pair has exactly the same intentions has made the same plans and so on but things turn out very differently and so both are subject to resultant luck If in either case we can correctly offer different moral assessments for each member of the pair then we have a case of resultant moral luck Williams offers a case of decision under uncertainty a somewhat fictionalized Gauguin who chooses a life of painting in Tahiti over a life with his family not knowing whether he will be a great painter In one scenario he goes on to become a great painter and in another he fails According to Williams we will judge Gauguin differently depending on the outcome Cases of negligence provide another important kind of resultant luck Imagine that two otherwise conscientious people have forgotten to have their brakes checked recently and experience brake failure but only one of whom finds a child in the path of his car If in any of these cases we correctly offer differential moral assessments then again we have cases of resultant moral luck Circumstantial luck Circumstantial luck is luck in the circumstances in which one finds oneself For example consider Nazi collaborators in Germany who are condemned for committing morally atrocious acts even though their very presence in Nazi Germany was due to factors beyond their control Nagel Had those very people been transferred by the companies for which they worked to Argentina in perhaps they would have led exemplary lives If we correctly morally assess the Nazi collaborators differently from their imaginary counterparts in Argentina then we have a case of circumstantial moral luck Constitutive luck Constitutive luck is luck in who one is or in the traits and dispositions that one has Since our genes care givers peers and other environmental influences all contribute to making us who we are and since we have no control over these it seems that who we are is at least largely a matter of luck Since how we act is partly a function of who we are the existence of constitutive luck entails that what actions we perform depends on luck too For example if we correctly blame someone for being cowardly or self righteous or selfish when his being so depends on factors beyond his control then we have a case of constitutive moral luck Further if a person acts on one of these very character traits over which he lacks control by say running away instead of helping to save his child and we correctly blame him for so acting then we also have a case of constitutive moral luck Thus since both actions and agents are objects of moral assessment constitutive moral luck undermines the Control Principle when it comes to the assessment of both actions and agents Causal luck Finally there is causal luck or luck in how one is determined by antecedent circumstances Nagel Nagel points out that the appearance of causal moral luck is essentially the classic problem of free will The problem of free will to which Nagel refers arises because it seems that our actions and even the stripped down acts of the will are consequences of what is not in our control If this is so then neither our actions nor our willing are free And since freedom is often thought to be necessary for moral responsibility we cannot be morally responsible even for our willings Sometimes the problem is thought to arise only if determinism is true but this is not the case Even if it turns out that determinism is false but events are still caused by prior events according to probabilistic laws the way that one is caused to act by antecedent circumstances would seem to be equally outside of one control Pereboom Watson Finally it is worth noting that some have viewed the inclusion of the category of causal luck as redundant since what it covers is completely captured by the combination of constitutive and circumstantial luck Latus Upon reflection it seems that we morally assess people differently for what they do or who they are when their actions and personal qualities depend on luck of all kinds And it is not only in unusual cases like that of would be murderers that people are subject to the various types of luck For example whether any of our intentions are realized in action or not depends on some factors outside of our control Thus if resultant luck undermines our assessments of moral responsibility as the Control Principle suggests then many of our everyday judgments ought to be abandoned Still applying the Control Principle to resultant luck continues to leave open the possibility that we are correctly assessed for things like our intentions just not for the results of our intentions But consideration of the other sorts of luck leads to more and more global skepticism about moral assessment For example circumstantial luck affects even our intentions so it seems that we cannot be assessed in virtue of our intentions Once again though we might still be able to retain the idea that we are morally assessable for something even if only for what we would have intended in various situations But reflection on constitutive luck and causal luck can make it seem as though we cannot be properly assessed for anything we do For if who we are and therefore what we would have done are themselves subject to luck then according to the Control Principle we cannot be properly assessed even for those things What is left as an object of assessment As Nagel puts it he area of genuine agency and therefore of legitimate moral judgment seems to shrink under this scrutiny to an extensionless point He goes on I believe that in a sense the problem has no solution because something in the idea of agency is incompatible with actions being events or people being things But as the external determinants of what someone has done are gradually exposed in their effect on consequences character and choice itself it becomes gradually clear that actions are events and people things Eventually nothing remains which can be ascribed to the responsible self and we are left with nothing but a portion of the larger sequence of events which can be deplored or celebrated but not blamed or praised If this is right then we could not simply revise our everyday moral judgments in accordance with a more diligent application of the Control Principle at best if we adhere to the Control Principle we should refrain from making any moral judgments Not everyone shares this skepticism and there is naturally a wide variety of responses to the challenge of how to reconcile our adherence to the Control Principle with our everyday judgments that commit us to the existence of moral luck At stake are not only our seemingly ubiquitous practices of moral praise and blame but also the resolution of other central debates in ethics philosophy of law and political philosophy Implications for Other Debates Before turning to proposed solutions to the problem it will be helpful to see just what rests on resolving the problem of moral luck The Justification of Laws and Punishment Whether or not we accept reject or qualify the Control Principle has implications for the law and for punishment in particular The question of how resultant luck should affect punishment has been debated at least since Plato The Laws IX According to the Control Principle if results are not in our control then our attributions of moral responsibility and blameworthiness should not be affected by them And if in addition justified punishment tracks moral blameworthiness then the degree of punishment allotted for crimes should not be based even in part on results A Hart puts this conclusion in the form of a rhetorical question Why should the accidental fact that an intended harmful outcome has not occurred be a ground for punishing less a criminal who may be equally dangerous and equally wicked It turns out however that the idea that results should not be taken into account in determining punishment is in direct tension with a variety of criminal laws including for example the differential punishment accorded attempted murder and murder in the United States It is also in direct tension with parts of the tort law in the United States such as the differential treatment accorded the merely negligent person and the negligent person whose negligence leads to harm Interestingly however the Model Penal Code takes a different approach for at least some offenses prescribing the same punishment for attempts and completed crimes Model Penal Code cmt at Official Draft and Revised Comments And this approach is favored by a number of legal theorists Now the line of reasoning sketched above that rejects any tracking of results in punishment depends not only on the Control Principle or a modified version of it but also on a thesis that limits justified punishment to the proper objects of moral blameworthiness Both of these premises can and have been questioned But the debate in legal theory about whether results should make a difference to punishment very often centers on the premise about control and thus the status of the Control Principle has important implications for the legal debates concerning differential punishment for attempts and completed crimes On this debate see for example Alexander Ferzan and Morse Davis Feinberg Herman Kadish Lewis Moore and Ripstein and Yaffe On luck and tort law see Waldron and for a wide ranging discussion of moral luck and the law Enoch It is also important to note that the implications of the status of the Control Principle for the law are not limited to results For example if we accept the Control Principle in unqualified form and accept the premise constraining justified punishment to that for which people are morally blameworthy then it might turn out that no one is morally blameworthy and so no punishment is ever justified Egalitarianism Whether or not the Control Principle is true either in its general or in some restricted form also has implications for the debate over what if anything justifies egalitarianism Let us understand egalitarianism as the view that a distribution of relevant goods that is more equal over a relevant population is more just than one that is less equal Inspired by the work of John Rawls some egalitarians have invoked the idea that our constitution and circumstances are out of our control in the justification of their view For example Rawls writes that The existing distribution of income and wealth say is the cumulative effect of prior distributions of natural assets that is natural talents and abilities as these have been developed or left unrealized and their use favored or disfavored over time by social circumstances and such chance contingencies as accident and good fortune Intuitively the most obvious injustice of the system of natural liberty is that it permits distributive shares to be improperly influenced by these factors so arbitrary from a moral point of view Rawls Egalitarians who treat luck in this way are sometimes called luck egalitarians For examples of various versions of luck egalitarianism see Arneson Cohen Dworkin and Roemer for criticisms see Nozick Anderson Hurley and Scheffler It is often difficult to see exactly how the appeal to constitutive luck is meant to function in various arguments for egalitarianism There are two very general ways the reasoning might go a positive and a negative way Nozick According to one positive line of reasoning it is first observed that one natural talents circumstances of birth and so on are things that are beyond one control and at the same time if a natural free market system operates these circumstances give rise to many advantages and disadvantages relative to others By the Control Principle one is not responsible for these advantages and disadvantages Further it is wrong for people to have advantages and disadvantages for which they are not responsible Therefore justice requires a more egalitarian redistribution of goods to rectify this wrong Although this line of reasoning has received much criticism it is arguable that a weaker and so less vulnerable negative line of reasoning is really behind much of luck egalitarianism see for example Arneson The negative luck argument for egalitarianism is really a rebuttal to the objection that people should not be deprived in the name of egalitarianism of what they have earned The argument goes like this Take as a starting point a presumption in favor of equality of condition Next observe as before that one natural talents circumstances of birth and so on are things beyond one control and again that these factors often give rise to advantages and disadvantages relative to others Therefore by the Control Principle one is not responsible for many advantages and disadvantages If one is not responsible for these then one is not deserving of them And if one is not deserving of them then it is not wrong to redistribute goods in a more egalitarian way that eliminates many advantages and disadvantages The explicit appeal to the Control Principle in both of these lines of reasoning shows ways in which the plausibility of Luck Egalitarianism depends on the resolution of the problem of moral luck It is also notable that some luck egalitarians attempt to draw a line between certain sorts of luck for example it is sometimes argued that if one suffers a great financial setback due to one choice to engage in high stakes gambling then there might be circumstances in which it would be wrong to seek to treat one in the same way as another whose equal suffering was brought on by say a devastating earthquake It might be that underlying this move is acceptance of a restricted version of the Control Principle for example one that allows that one can be responsible for one choices and their expected consequences but not for the results of one choices that are in large part beyond one control Here too it is clear that how one resolves the problem of moral luck whether one rejects the possibility of moral luck altogether accepts it in all forms or accepts certain kinds and not others has implications for the ultimate success of Luck Egalitarianism Thus much is at stake in the resolution of the problem of moral luck Before turning to suggested solutions a brief bit of ground clearing will be necessary Kinds of Moral Assessment The Control Principle states that we are morally assessable only to the extent that what we are morally assessed for is under our control But it is important to recognize that there are many different kinds of moral assessment For example there are judgments about a person character for example as good or bad sometimes called aretaic judgments There are also judgments of states of affairs that concern people actions as good or bad sometimes called axiological judgments Then there are judgments of actions as right or wrong sometimes called deontic judgments There are also judgments of responsibility blame and praise As we will see this category can be further divided in various ways Distinguishing between the various notions of moral assessment allows for the possibility that the Control Principle should be read as applying to some but not to other forms of moral assessment For example some argue that there is a perfectly acceptable form of moral luck which does not conflict with the true spirit of the Control Principle namely luck in what you are responsible for Richards Zimmerman For example it will be readily admitted by many that the successful murderer can be responsible for a death whereas the one who unsuccessfully attempts murder is not responsible for a death At the same time both could be equally responsible or blameworthy in degree Zimmerman or both could be equal in their moral worth Richards Greco If the most important kind of moral assessment is say one moral worth then the Control Principle can be suitably restricted to apply to assessments of moral worth As will become clear a number of responses to the problem of moral luck appeal to the general strategy of distinguishing among different forms of moral assessment Most focus on two families of moral assessment the family that includes responsibility blame and praise for actions and or for one own traits or dispositions and ii the family that includes the notion of the moral worth of an agent and the moral quality of her character But see Zimmerman for a recent discussion of luck and deontic judgments Responding to the Problem Three Approaches There are three general approaches to responding to the problem of moral luck to deny that there is moral luck despite appearances ii to accept the existence of moral luck while rejecting or restricting the Control Principle or iii to argue that it is simply incoherent to accept or deny the existence of some type of moral luck so that with respect to at least the relevant types of moral luck the problem of moral luck does not arise Some who respond to the problem of moral luck take a single approach to all kinds of luck But many take a mixed approach that is they embrace one approach for one kind of luck and another approach for another kind of luck or address only a certain type of luck while remaining silent about the other types Is taking a mixed approach legitimate After all it seems that if the Control Principle is true then there is no moral luck and if it is false then there can be any type of moral luck But alas matters are not necessarily so simple It is possible at least in theory to offer a principled reason for qualifying the Control Principle so that it applies only to certain sorts of factors and not others At the same time as we will see providing just such a principled way of distinguishing certain kinds of luck from others turns out to be a formidable task Denial Most of those who deny that one or more types of moral luck exist are those who seek to preserve the centrality of morality in our lives But it is also possible to adopt a position of denying the possibility of moral luck while at the same time showing that the Control Principle while true prevents morality from playing the central role we might have hoped for it Something like this position seems to be the one Williams adopts in his Postscript to Moral Luck for example Denying Moral Luck and Preserving the Centrality of Morality Let us begin with the first and larger group of those who embrace the approach of denying the existence of moral luck One of their main tasks is to explain away the appearance of moral luck A second main task is to paint a plausible and coherent picture of morality that avoids luck An important tool for those who wish to explain away the existence of moral luck is what Latus calls the epistemic argument see Richards Rescher Rosebury and Thomson To see how it goes let us begin by focusing on resultant luck Why do we feel differently about the successful and unsuccessful murderers Because according to the epistemic argument we rarely know exactly what a person intentions are or the strength of her commitment to a course of action One admittedly fallible indicator is whether she succeeds or not In particular if someone succeeds that is some evidence that the person was seriously committed to carrying out a fully formed plan The same evidence is not usually available when the plan is not carried out Thus rather than indicating our commitment to cases of resultant moral luck our differential treatment of successful and unsuccessful murderers indicates our different epistemic situations with respect to each If we were in the unrealistic situation of knowing that both agents had exactly the same intentions the same strength of commitment to their plans and so on then we would no longer be inclined to treat them differently Thomson represents a number of those who employ this strategy when she asks Well do we regard Bert a negligent driver who causes a death with an indignation that would be out of place in respect to Carol an equally negligent driver who does not Even after we have been told about how bad luck figured in his history and good luck in hers And Thomson answers I do not find it in myself to do so Not everyone shares this intuition however as we will see in the next section The epistemic argument can be extended to circumstantial luck Consider again the Nazi sympathizer and a counterpart who moved in to Argentina on business The counterpart has exactly the same dispositions as the Nazi sympathizer but lives a quiet and harmless life in Argentina According to this line of reasoning while it is true that the counterpart is not responsible for the same deeds as the Nazi sympathizer he should be judged precisely for what he would have done Richards argues that we do judge people for what they would have done but that what they do is often our strongest evidence for what they would have done As a result given our limited knowledge we might not be entitled to treat the counterpart in the same way as the Nazi sympathizer even though they are equally morally deserving of such treatment Richards ff Thus circumstantial luck like resultant luck affects the basis available to us when we judge agents but does not affect what those agents deserve It is hard to see how the argument can be extended further to cover constitutive or causal luck But even if the epistemic argument is limited in this way it can still be part of a good overall strategy of responding to the problem of moral luck insofar as it is possible to take a mix and match approach to different kinds of luck A second strategy for explaining away moral luck is most naturally applied to resultant luck Those who adopt this strategy argue that it is understandable or even appropriate to feel differently about the driver who kills a child than about the one who does not What is not appropriate is to offer different moral assessments of their behavior Rosebury Richards Wolf Thomson Williams elucidates a notion of agent regret a sentiment whose constitutive thought is a subject first person thought that it would have been much better had she done otherwise Agent regret also requires a certain sort of expression that is different from that of what we might call bystander regret For example it might include the willingness to compensate a person who was harmed by one actions In the case of a lorry driver who through no fault of his own runs over a child Williams writes we feel sorry for the driver but that sentiment co exists with indeed presupposes that there is something special about his relation to this happening something which cannot merely be eliminated by the consideration that it was not his fault It is possible to take this thought still further and argue that it is reasonable to expect and perhaps even demand that one who kills the child respond in a different way from the other For example Wolf argues that there is a nameless virtue which consists in taking responsibility for one actions and their consequences It is the virtue of taking responsibility in some sense for the consequences of one actions even if one is not responsible for them In some ways it is akin to the virtue of generosity in that it involves a willingness to give more that justice requires To take another example Richards suggests that we often have negative feelings about those who cause harm even when we realize that they are not deserved and that these can be feelings we ought to have For example it ought to be distressing for a parent to encounter a girl who accidentally dropped your baby even if you know that no one could have held on The feelings that both agents and observers naturally do or even ought to have can easily be confused with judgments that commit us to the existence of moral luck Yet once we distinguish these legitimate feelings from moral judgments we can and should eliminate the judgments that entail a commitment to moral luck Again this strategy is most naturally applied to resultant luck Recently critics of this strategy have objected to it on a variety of grounds For example it has been argued against Wolf view in particular that once we acknowledge the appropriateness of greater self blame in cases of greater harm no good reason for denying moral luck remains and indeed we have good reason for accepting it See Moore ff It has also been argued that Wolf description of our phenomenology is at best incomplete it is not merely that we wish people to blame themselves more when they cause greater harm but that we judge them to be more blameworthy Our judgments of greater responsibility also require explaining away See Domsky A variant of this strategy employs the idea that one can justify differential treatment of say the negligent driver who hits a child and one who does not even if both are equally morally blameworthy For example Henning Jensen argues that while both are equally culpable there are consequentialist reasons for not subjecting the first negligent driver to the same degree of blame behavior Since we all take some risks and some are less likely to lead to harm than others to blame everyone for simply taking such risks would require such a high standard of care as to risk destroying our ability to function as moral agents On the other hand requiring punishment for or compensation from those who do cause harm is required to provide a restorative value for those agents and preserve their integrity A third strategy is to point out that we mistakenly infer moral luck from legal luck While there might be good reasons for the law to treat people differently even if what they do depends on factors beyond their control we understandably make the mistaken inference that the law directly reflects correct moral assessment in such cases For example there are a number of reasons why the law might justifiably punish successful crimes more severely than merely attempted ones including the balancing of deterrence and privacy Rosebury If reasons like this provide the justification for the differential treatment of such cases in the law then it would indeed be wrong to infer that the successful and unsuccessful murderers are deserving of different moral assessments However the fact that we do make such a mistaken inference explains why we often commit ourselves to the existence of moral luck when reflection can show that doing so is a mistake In addition to explaining how there can be an appearance of moral luck despite the fact that there is not any some of those who wish to deny the existence of moral luck take on the task of offering a coherent and plausible picture of morality that avoids luck Some of those engaged in the free will debate have denied the existence of causal and perhaps also of constitutive moral luck by offering a distinctive metaphysical account of human agency See for example Chisholm Taylor Clarke and Connor See also Pereboom who argues that such an account is coherent but not true The view is known as Agent Causal Libertarianism and the basic idea is that agents themselves cause actions or at least the formation of intentions without their being caused to do so Thus the agent herself as a substance exercising her causal powers is an undetermined cause of her intentions On some agent causal views only the agent as opposed to events caused by other events is the cause of the intention Connor while on another view the agent acts in tandem with events that probabilistically cause the action Clarke Particularly on the first sort of view we seem to avoid the conclusion that our actions must depend on causal factors that are beyond our control At the same time it is not clear exactly how the move to agent causation is supposed to restore the kind of control we seek For we might ask why we should consider the agent cause in control of her actions while we can imagine that other substance causes tables or billiard balls would not be in control of what they cause It might be stipulated that the exercise of the particular causal power to cause intentions simply is an exercise of control but we need further details to see that the challenge has not been stipulated away See Clarke and Mele for recent discussions of agent causation and luck It is also important to note that Agent Causal views are consistent with actions and even intentions depending in part on factors beyond one control such as the reasons people have available at the time of decision or action In a very different way as we have seen it is possible to take on a part of the task of describing a coherent picture of luck free morality by identifying an object of moral assessment in the case of circumstantial luck For example Richards suggests that people should be assessed for what they would have done in different circumstances More fundamentally people should be assessed for their characters of which their actions in different circumstances are manifestations Zimmerman begins where Richards leaves off proposing to pursue the implications of the denial of the relevance of luck to moral responsibility to their logical conclusion With the possible exception of some kinds of constitutive luck Zimmerman rejects the possibility of moral luck of all four kinds while proposing a coherent picture of moral assessment He rejects the possibility of resultant luck by first acknowledging that a man who by luck succeeds in his plan to cause harm is responsible for more things than one who by luck fails to carry out an identical plan But according to Zimmerman we must distinguish between scope and degree of responsibility Both men are responsible to the same degree and it is this kind of moral assessment to which the Control Principle ought to apply When it comes to circumstantial luck things are more difficult For when it comes to cases like those of resultant luck in which we want to hold people responsible we can find something to hold them responsible for namely their plans or intentions or attempts However when it comes to cases of circumstantial luck such as the Nazi collaborator and his counterpart there are no counterpart plans or intentions or attempts that have simply failed to come to fruition Zimmerman suggests that there is nothing that we hold the counterpart responsible for in this case the scope of the agent responsibility is But we can and should still hold him responsible to the same degree as the Nazi sympathizer He is responsible tout court even if he is not responsible for anything He is responsible in the sense that his moral record is affected for better or worse in virtue of something about him For there is something in virtue of which he is responsible namely his being such that he would have freely performed the very same wrong actions had he been in the same circumstances as the Nazi sympathizer This reasoning can be extended still further to cover the case of constitutive and even one kind of causal luck Suppose that Georg does not kill Henrik and George does kill Henry Further suppose that the reason for Georg not killing Henrik was that he was too timid or that he had a thick skin and Henrik insults did not upset him in the way that Henry insults upset George or that he was deaf and simply did not hear the insults that Henrik hurled his way If it is nonetheless true that Georg would have freely shot and killed Henrik but for some such feature of the case over which he had no control then I contend he is just as responsible in virtue of this fact as George is Zimmerman acknowledges that there are features of one constitution that are essential to who one is although he denies that timidity thick skinnedness and so on count among them However if such features are essential then it will not be true to say that had Georg lacked them he would have freely killed Henrik Since Georg is responsible on Zimmerman view precisely in virtue of such counterfactuals being true he would be absolved of responsibility if such features were essential to him For this reason Zimmerman concedes that the role that luck plays in the determination of moral responsibility may not be entirely eliminable Finally Zimmerman goes on to claim that his reasoning applies even to cases in which a person actions are causally determined If it is true that say Georg would have killed Henrik if his deterministic causal history over which he has no control had been different then Georg is as responsible as he would have been had he killed Henrik in a world that was not determined The upshot of the application of Zimmerman reasoning is that we are all responsible blameworthy and even praiseworthy in ways we have never imagined If Zimmerman is right there are countless counterfactuals that apply to each and every one of us in virtue of which we are responsible to one degree or another The view thus takes the Control Principle extremely seriously and applies it in the broadest possible way The price we pay for taking luck seriously is that our everyday moral judgments are if not always mistaken at the very least radically incomplete A number of objections can be raised to Zimmerman view including that at least large classes of the counterfactuals in virtue of which he thinks people are responsible lack truth value Adams Nelkin and Zimmerman and ii that he is simply mistaken that one can be responsible without being responsible for anything Even if one or both of these objections are on target Zimmerman article is very helpful in showing what an attempt to follow out the denial of moral luck to its logical conclusion looks like Unlike Zimmerman most of those who adopt the denial strategy do so only for certain sorts of moral luck By treating all sorts of luck in the same way with the exception of constitutive luck with respect to one essential properties Zimmerman challenges those who adopt this strategy to defend the drawing of the line between resultant and other sorts of luck As we will see this very same challenge is also issued by those who take a diametrically opposed position and accept all forms of moral luck Denying Moral Luck and Setting Aside Morality in Favor of Ethics Before turning to the approach of accepting the existence of moral luck it remains to consider the view ascribed earlier to Williams Postscript Extracting Williams position on Moral Luck is a notoriously difficult task made easier only by Williams own acknowledgment in the Postscript that his original article may have encouraged some misunderstandings Many commentators have read Williams as advocating the position that moral luck exists and is deeply threatening to morality There is certainly a line of reasoning in Williams original article that suggests this see But in the Postscript Williams makes a distinction between morality and ethics that allows him to deny the existence of moral luck thus preserving a certain integrity for morality Williams understands morality to embody the Kantian conception of it described above accepting that the essence of the Control Principle is built into morality so understood At the same time examples like the Gauguin case described earlier show that one can be rationally justified in one decision in virtue of its outcome Further such a case shows that our overall value judgment of someone decision can depend on factors beyond the control of the agent We must conclude then that there is a kind of value that competes with if not trumps moral value And if that is right then we must give up the point of morality so understood namely to provide a shelter against luck one realm of value indeed of supreme value that is defended against contingency emphasis mine It seems that morality can only insulate itself from luck at the expense of foregoing supreme value Once we acknowledge this cost we can keep morality intact although skeptical doubts about its ability to resist luck can still be raised but we have lost our reason to care about it Instead Williams suggests we should care about ethics where ethics is understood to address the most general question of how we ought to live Questions can be raised about this line of reasoning For example we can ask whether there is any sense in which Williams Gauguin ought to have left his family despite the fact that the result was so welcome If there is not then Williams has not shown that morality competes with or is trumped by some other value From the other direction we can ask whether Williams is right that morality loses its point if it is not the supreme source of value Of course even if Williams reasoning is unsound the conclusion could still be correct and others have offered different routes to it The idea that we ought to care about ethics understood as Williams does finds inspiration in the work of Aristotle Aristotle is concerned with the nature of the good life in the broadest sense in what he calls eudaimonia often translated as happiness Aristotle defends the idea that happiness consists in being a virtuous person over a complete life and in turn the idea that being a virtuous person requires not only that one have virtuous qualities and dispositions but also that one act on them Luck enters into the account in at least two ways First on Aristotle account one becomes a virtuous person by undergoing the right kind of upbringing and training Since whether one receives this training is at least to some extent beyond one control one ability to live a virtuous life is deeply dependent on luck Second the fact that being a virtuous person requires the performance of certain kinds of activities means that the world must cooperate in various ways in order for one to be truly virtuous and so be truly happy Aristotle writes that happiness needs the external goods as well for it is impossible or not easy to do noble acts without proper equipment NE For example in order to engage in acts of generosity one must have resources at one disposal to share And since having the right equipment is at least to some extent a matter of circumstantial luck the value of one life itself will depend in part on what is not in one control On one interpretation of Aristotle luck enters into the account in yet a third way Acting in accordance with virtue does not suffice for happiness on this interpretation although it is the dominant component of Aristotle account of happiness Irwin According to this view one must also have a minimum provision of external goods health security access to resources whose contribution to happiness is independent of their making virtuous activity possible If this is right then the value of one life will depend at least in part on factors beyond one control In sum while there is some dispute about whether Aristotle thought more than a life of virtuous activity is required for happiness it is clear that luck plays a significant role in determining both whether people are truly virtuous and whether people lives are good in the broadest sense Hence the fragility of goodness Nussbaum Acceptance All of those who accept the existence of some type of moral luck reject the Control Principle and the Kantian conception of morality that embraces it As a result they must either explain how we can revise our moral judgments and practices in a coherent way or show that we are not committed to the Control Principle in the first place Accepting Moral Luck and Revising our Practices Some who accept luck argue that doing so requires a significant change in our moral practices Browne for example suggests that if the Control Principle is false we ought not to respond to an agent wrongdoing with anger and blame that is against him but rather with anger that does not include hostility or the desire to punish Nevertheless we can still respond to the successful murderer with more of the right kind of anger than we feel toward the unsuccessful one One question that might be raised here is whether we are left with enough of our ordinary conception of morality to include genuine notions of blame and responsibility Accepting Moral Luck without Revision Others suggest that the Control Principle does not have nearly the hold on us that Nagel and Williams assume and that rejecting it would not change our practices in a significant way Among these are some who focus on the free will debate and others who take on the broader problem of moral luck directly Accepting Moral Luck and the Free Will Debate A large group who accept moral luck do not explicitly address the problem of moral luck as so formulated because they focus on what Nagel identifies as a narrower issue namely that of free will One traditional problem of free will is posed by the following line of reasoning if determinism is true then no one can act freely and assuming that freedom is necessary for responsibility no one can be responsible for their actions Compatibilists have argued that we can act freely and responsibly even if determinism is true Since most do not adopt Zimmerman radical account of moral assessment in which one can be responsible despite not being responsible for anything they admit the existence of causal moral luck If as some have argued causal luck is exhausted by constitutive and circumstantial luck then they also accept that there can be these sorts of moral luck as well A basic compatibilist strategy is to argue that agents can have control over their actions in the sense required for freedom and or responsibility even if they do not control the causal determinants of those actions For example if one acts with the ability to act in accordance with good reasons Wolf or if one acts with guidance control which consists in part of acting on a reasons responsive mechanism for which one has taken responsibility Fischer and Ravizza one can be responsible for one actions The key move here is to distinguish between different kinds of factors over which one has no control If one actions are caused by factors that one does not control and that prevent one from having or exercising certain capacities then one is not responsible However if one actions are caused by factors that one does not control but that do allow one to have and exercise the relevant capacities then one can be in control of one actions in the relevant sense and so responsible for one actions Interestingly compatibilists are often silent on the question of resultant and circumstantial moral luck although these forms of luck might represent an underutilized resource for them For if it turns out that the luck or lack of control delivered by determinism is but one source of luck among others then determinism does not embody a unique obstacle to free will and responsibility at least when it comes to control This is to expand the application of a widely used compatibilist strategy to show that when it comes to causal luck compatibilists are not alone For within the free will debate compatibilists are not alone in accepting the existence of certain types of luck Many libertarians assume that our actions are caused by prior events not themselves in our control in accordance with probabilistic laws of nature see for example Kane Nozick Given this view it is natural to conclude that if determinism is false there is at least one kind of luck in what sort of person one decides to be and so in what actions one performs That is there is luck in the sense that there is no explanation as to why a person chose to be one way rather than another At the same time Kane for example denies that there must be luck in the sense that one choices are flukes or accidents if determinism is false In Kane view what is important is to be free from luck of the second kind For even if one action is not determined it can still be the case that the causes of one action are one own efforts and intention And if one action is caused by one own efforts and intentions then one action is not lucky in the sense of being a fluke or accident But while this shows that one actions can be free of luck of an important kind it still leaves unaddressed luck of a third kind namely the kind at issue in the moral luck debate the dependence of agents choices on factors beyond their control And it appears that on the libertarian view in question our choices are indeed subject to luck of this sort See Pereboom for a discussion of the similar burdens shared by compatibilists and this sort of libertarian Only the agent causal libertarians discussed above offer an account that aims specifically at eliminating a type of moral luck Accepting Moral Luck and Distinctive Conceptions of Morality It is also possible to argue that we are not committed to the Control Principle by taking on the problem of moral luck directly One strategy is to argue that moral luck is only a problem for an overly idealized conception of human agency But once we adopt a realistic conception of human agency the problem evaporates Margaret Urban Walker argues in this vein that moral luck is only problematic for a conception of moral agents as noumenal or pure In contrast adopting a conception of morality that applies to human beings in all of their impurity will not be threatened by moral luck According to Walker the Control Principle is far from obvious and we would not want to live in a world in which it held sway The argument appears to rest on the idea that without moral luck we would lack several virtues that allow us to help each other in most essential ways Our very reactions to moral luck can be virtuous For example by accepting that our responsibilities outrun control we are able to display the virtue of dependability by accepting that we will be there for our friends even if their needs are not in our control In contrast pure agents who are only responsible for what they control may not be depended on much less morally required to assume a share of the ongoing and massive human work of caring healing restoring and cleaning up on which each separate life and the collective one depend Thus if we focus on our actual moral commitments we will see that the Control Principle is neither attractive nor necessary for morality It is not obvious that a world in which people denied the existence of moral luck would be as bleak as the one Walker envisions Moral luck skeptics have material with which to question Walker claim For example those who deny resultant moral luck can still agree that agents have an obligation to minimize their risks of doing harm and those who deny circumstantial moral luck can still agree that agents have an obligation to cultivate qualities that prepare them to act well in whatever circumstances arise A second strategy for rejecting the Control Principle turns Nagel argument on its head by taking as a starting point ordinary judgments and reactions that reveal our implicit rejection of the Control Principle Adams adopts this strategy drawing our attention to common practices such as blaming people for their racist attitudes even if we do not think that such people are in control of their attitudes Since Adams focuses primarily on agents states of mind that have intentional objects such as anger and self righteousness it is possible to see him as accepting the existence of constitutive moral luck in particular But it is also possible to adopt the same sort of strategy for other sorts of luck including resultant luck Moore and for example points to the fact that we resent those who succeed in causing harm more than those who do not we feel greater guilt when we ourselves cause harm and when we face decisions we feel that the consequences of matter to the moral quality of our choices According to Moore the best explanation of these reactive attitudes such as guilt and resentment is that their objects are genuinely more blameworthy Now opponents who deny the existence of moral luck have ways of explaining away these phenomena When it comes to cases of constitutive luck like the case of the racist they can say that we confuse agents blameworthiness for their character and attitudes with blameworthiness for their actions that manifest these offending attitudes and for their failure to take steps to eliminate them On reflection we can see that we ought to blame the racists only for their actions or omissions not for the attitudes themselves over which they have no control Similarly as we saw earlier when it comes to resultant luck moral luck skeptics have a variety of strong alternative explanations of our judgments and emotional responses It is possible that there is a disagreement here at the level of intuitions some find it easier on reflection to reject moral judgments that depend on results than others Further those accepting resultant moral luck face a challenge of articulating a positive theory of how exactly results affect one moral status while at the same time accounting for our intuitions Sverdlik argues that it is not obvious how such a challenge can be met At this point in the debate those who accept moral luck offer ordinary judgments and responses in their defense while moral luck skeptics offer alternative explanations of those practices and hold up the Control Principle itself together with other reflective intuitive judgments as reason to reject moral luck We seem to have something of a stalemate So it is no surprise that those who accept moral luck tend not to rely exclusively on ordinary judgments to make their case but rather go on to try to undermine the Control Principle in other ways Another way of trying to undermine the appeal of the Control Principle itself is to show how it might be mistaken for something else that is more plausible For example Adams recognizes that there are limits to what we can be responsible for and writes that the states of mind for which we are directly responsible are those in which we are responding consciously or unconsciously to data that are rich enough to permit a fairly adequate ethical appreciation of the state intentional object and of the object place in the fabric of personal relationships Thus according to Adams conception of morality adherents of the Control Principle are correct in an important respect namely in their understanding that what one is responsible for springs in the right way from oneself But this requirement is more general than a strict requirement of control and although easily confused with the Control Principle is superior to it on this view Adopting the same general strategy Moore identifies still other principles with which the Control Principle might be confused He points out that when we use the word luck in the context of moral assessment we tend not to mean that the person lacked control over what he did but rather that what happened was far off of some moral baseline of the normal For example consider two would be murderers one of whom fires his gun and hits his target and the other of whom fires in the same way from the same distance and so on but whose bullet is deflected by an unexpected and unusually strong wind Moore suggests that the first gunman is not lucky in the ordinary sense even though it is true that whether a hurricane force wind arose or not was not in his control According to Moore there is something intuitively right about morality being immune to luck but only if we understand luck in the sense of freakishness Further the successful murderer is in control of his action in the normal sense of the word control even though he doesn control the wind Thus while we do care about luck and control in making both moral and legal assessments they aren Nagel concepts on this view Thus according to Moore there is no contradiction in our everyday commitments Now those who think we are naturally drawn to the Control Principle can respond by pointing out both the intuitive plausibility of the principle in the abstract and the cases described earlier that seem to support it They might also accept that Adams and Moore have pointed out further necessary conditions for responsibility while still maintaining that the Control Principle is true Again differing intuitions about cases and about the Control Principle have the potential to make a big difference to one view at this point Michael Otsuka offers yet another principle in place of the Control Principle One is only blameworthy in cases in which one had the kind of control that would have allowed one to be entirely blameless Consistent with this is a kind of moral luck however one blameworthiness can vary in degree as a function of harm done where harm done may be affected by what is not in one control Although one cannot be blameworthy if one lacked the control necessary to avoid blameworthiness one degree of blameworthiness can increase if the risk one takes comes out badly due to circumstances one could do nothing to avoid For example in the case of the two assassins both are blameworthy but Otsuka argues the one who hits and kills his target is more blameworthy In sketching the view Otsuka draws a parallel with Dworkin treatment of option luck in the debate over egalitarianism In that debate a distinction is drawn between option luck a matter of whether someone gains or loses through accepting an isolated risk he or she should have anticipated and might have declined and brute luck a matter of how risks fall out that are not that sense gambles If one luck is just brute one did not assume a risk as when one has done everything a careful driver would do and due to sheer luck a dog runs into the street and one drives over it one is not blameworthy But if one assumes a risk by knowingly and freely driving recklessly and as a result one kills a dog then one is blameworthy And further one might be more blameworthy in the case in which one kills the dog than in the case in which one takes the same risk but luckily reaches home without hitting anything It would be reasonable on Otsuka view for the dog owner whose dog is killed to be more resentful than the one whose dog escapes and this supports the conclusion that the driver who kills the dog is more blameworthy than the one who does not The parallel to option an brute luck is suggestive but a defender of the unqualified Control principle has resources here Appealing to the distinction between scope and degree one might grant that the reckless driver is importantly responsible for more things including a death but not more blameworthy In fact the parallel to the treatment of option luck in the debate about distributive justice may fit best if we are interested in what we are responsible for rather than how responsible we are Further we have seen reason to think that on reflection we should not blame one reckless driver more than another One might question Otsuka premise that degree of blameworthiness is to be understood in terms of appropriate degree of attitudes such as resentment or even the weaker premise that the degree of blameworthiness tracks the appropriate degree of such attitudes But even if we accept this premise we might conclude that while it is understandable that one dog owner would be more resentful than the first more resentment is not actually justified This observation takes us back to the subtle nature of the dialectic In adjudicating this debate between those defending the Control Principle and those defending alternative principles we can ask just how much weight should be given to our natural reactions to cases and in particular to our reactive attitudes such as resentment and guilt At least in some cases these can be tempered when we reflect explicitly on key features of cases and our initial responses can be revised in light of these reflections together with reflection on general principles Notably there has recently been an attempt by philosophers to appeal to results from empirical psychology to explain away some set of intuitions or other and this strategy has been applied in the area of moral luck in particular For just two examples see Domsky and Royzman and Kumar whose explanations in different ways support the preservation of our adherence to the Control Principle and see Enoch and Guttel for a reply to both Psychologists and experimental philosophers have also simply tried to offer explanations of our intuitions particularly of ones that appear to conflict as we find in the debate about moral luck For example see Cushman and Green who offer an explanation of apparently conflicting intuitions about moral results luck in terms of two dissociable processes and Bj√∂rnsson and Persson who offer an explanation in terms of shifting explanatory perspectives It is worth noting however as several of these authors do themselves that even if we were confident in our possession of psychological explanations of our intuitions there would still be philosophical work to do to sort out what the normative facts are And given the variety of proposals and results it seems we are not in a position to have that kind of confidence There is a final argument in favor of the acceptance of moral luck of a very different kind that might ultimately help decide the issue in one direction or the other It explicitly encompasses every kind of luck and thus poses a deep and difficult challenge to moral luck skeptics particularly the large group who focus exclusively on resultant luck The main idea is that rejecting resultant luck but not other sorts of luck is an unstable position Moore In a nutshell one cannot find a principled place to draw the line at refusing to accept moral luck In effect this argument is Nagel argument in reverse Begin by observing that we lack control over everything the results of our actions our circumstances our constitution and our causal history If we are to avoid moral skepticism then we must accept moral luck in some areas and if we do that then we ought to accept it in the area of results Particularly if we accept that we are not predisposed to accept the Control Principle in the first place then we ought to accept luck in all areas thereby avoiding moral skepticism Now even if no one has adequately defended a way of drawing a line between different sorts of luck it is not obvious that the door has been closed on all future attempts Thus one way of seeing this argument is as a shift the burden one Those who wish to draw a line between different sorts of moral luck must offer a deeper rationale for doing so than has yet been offered Incoherence According to this approach it is simply incoherent to accept or deny the existence of some type of moral luck This approach has been used for constitutive luck in particular Among those who wish to preserve the centrality of morality in our lives many have appealed to an idea formulated by Nicholas Rescher according to which ne cannot meaningfully said to be lucky in regard to who one is but only with respect to what happens to one Identity must precede luck It is easy to take Rescher point out of context without realizing that he is working with a notion of luck that differs from the notion of lack of control According to Rescher something is lucky if it came about by accident where this seems to mean something like unplanned or unexpected or out of the ordinary and ii the outcome has a significantly evaluative status in representing a good or bad result a benefit or loss Taken this way it does seem at least very odd to say that one identity is or is not a matter of luck But it is less clear that there is anything odd let alone incoherent about saying that one identity is not a matter within one control Could there nevertheless be some truth to Rescher claim even if we understand luck as out of one control Perhaps it does not make sense for example to say that a person is in control of who she is For one could argue that this would amount to saying that a person is a self creator And in fact the Control Principle taken to its logical extreme seems to lead to just such a requirement see Browne Nagel If it turns out that self creation is conceptually impossible as many argue Galen Strawson then perhaps there is a sense in which it is right to say that being in control of one constitution makes no sense But it does not follow from this that it is meaningless to deny that one can control one constitution Perhaps the best way of deploying the insight that there is something special about luck and constitution is not to say that it is meaningless to discuss it but to say that constitutive moral luck is simply unproblematic for morality in the way that resultant moral luck is This would be to take up the line drawing challenge as described in the last section On this line of reasoning for purposes of moral assessment it does not matter how you came to be what matters is what you do with what you are Of course as we saw this requires defense and explanation but it is a way of capturing the insight that constitutive luck is relevantly different from the resultant luck that has captivated a number of commentators Conclusion The problem of moral luck is deeply unsettling Naturally there is a wide variety of responses to it On the one extreme are those who deny that there is any sort of moral luck and on the other are those who accept every sort of moral luck Most writers who have responded to the problem fall somewhere in between either they explicitly take a mixed approach or they confine their arguments to a carefully delineated subset of types of moral luck while remaining uncommitted with respect to the others The extreme positions are vulnerable to the objection that they have left some consideration or other completely unaccounted for But those who occupy the middle also face a formidable challenge where can one draw a principled line between acceptable and unacceptable forms of luck As we have seen one apparently natural place to draw a line is between resultant luck and all of the other sorts On this view there is no resultant moral luck despite initial appearances although there is moral luck of all the other kinds Thus occupiers of this position face the challenge of setting out a plausible rationale for drawing the line where they do But they also face the challenge of where precisely to draw another line namely the line around what counts as results For we can ask on which side of this line do intentions willings bodily movements and so on fall Do results include everything that happens after the formation of an intention or the exertion of the will for example Or everything that follows the beginning of the formation of an intention or the beginning of the exertion of the will Or everything that follows the affection of the heart of which Adam Smith wrote so eloquently These are difficult questions for those who would draw a line at resultant luck But difficult questions await every other proposal too Fortunately there is a rich and growing literature providing a full spectrum of responses to explore Acknowledgments I am very grateful to David Brink Nina Davis Derk Pereboom and Sam Rickless for their very helpful input and constructive suggestions I also benefited greatly from participation in the University of San Diego Institute for Law and Philosophy Roundtable on Moral Luck in April Constructive mathematics is distinguished from its traditional counterpart classical mathematics by the strict interpretation of the phrase there exists as we can construct In order to work constructively we need to re interpret not only the existential quantifier but all the logical connectives and quantifiers as instructions on how to construct a proof of the statement involving these logical expressions In this article we introduce modern constructive mathematics based on the BHK interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers We discuss four major varieties of constructive mathematics with particular emphasis on the two varieties associated with Errett Bishop and Per Martin L√∂f which can be regarded as minimal constructive systems We then outline progress in informal constructive reverse mathematics a research programme seeking to identify principles such as Brouwer fan theorem that added to the minimal constructive varieties facilitate proofs of important analytic theorems Finally we describe two relatively recent constructive approaches to topology the theory of apartness spaces and formal topology Introduction The Constructive Interpretation of Logic Concluding Remarks Academic Tools Other Internet Resources Related Entries Introduction Before mathematicians assert something other than an axiom they are supposed to have proved it true What then do mathematicians mean when they assert a disjunction where and are syntactically correct statements in some formal or informal mathematical language A natural although as we shall see not the unique interpretation of this disjunction is that not only does at least one of the statements hold but also we can decide which one holds Thus just as mathematicians will assert only when they have decided that holds by proving it they may assert only when they either can produce a proof of or else produce one of With this interpretation however we run into a serious problem in the special case where is the negation of To assert is to show that implies a contradiction such as But it will often be that mathematicians have neither a proof of nor one of To see this we need only reflect on the following Goldbach conjecture GC Every even integer can be written as a sum of two primes which remains neither proved nor disproved despite the best efforts of many of the leading mathematicians since it was first raised in a letter from Goldbach to Euler in We are forced to conclude that under the very natural decidability interpretation of only a stubborn optimist can retain a belief in the law of excluded middle LEM For every statement either or holds Classical logic gets round this by widening the interpretation of disjunction it interprets as or in other words it is contradictory that both and be false In turn this leads to the idealistic interpretation of existence in which xP means it is contradictory that be false for every It is on these interpretations of disjunction and existence that mathematicians have built the grand and apparently impregnable edifice of classical mathematics which serves a foundation for the physical the social and increasingly the biological sciences However the wider interpretations come at a cost for example when we pass from our initial natural interpretation of to the unrestricted use of the idealistic one the resulting mathematics cannot generally be interpreted within computational models such as recursive function theory This point is illustrated by a well worn example the proposition There exist irrational numbers a such that ab is rational A slick classical proof goes as follows Either is rational in which case we take a or else is irrational in which case we take a and see Dummett But as it stands this proof does not enable us to pinpoint which of the two choices of the pair a has the required property In order to determine the correct choice of a we would need to decide whether is rational or irrational which is precisely to employ our initial interpretation of disjunction with the statement is rational Here is another illustration of the difference between interpretations Consider the following simple statement about the set of real numbers where for reasons that we divulge shortly means that we can find a rational number with A natural computational interpretation of is that we have a procedure which applied to any real number either tells us that or else tells us that For example such a procedure might output if and if However because the computer can handle real numbers only by means of finite rational approximations we have the problem of underflow in which a sufficiently small positive number can be misread as by the computer so there cannot be a decision procedure that justifies the statement In other words we cannot expect to hold under our natural computational interpretation of the quantifier and the connective Let examine this from another angle Let act as shorthand for the statement is a sum of two primes where ranges over the positive integers and define an infinite binary sequence a as follows an if holds for all if holds for some There is no question that a is a computationally well defined sequence in the sense that we have an algorithm for computing an for each check the even numbers to determine whether each of them is a sum of two primes in that case set an and in the contrary case set an Now consider the real number whose nth binary digit is an If holds under our computational interpretation then we can decide between the following two alternatives which implies that an for every we can find a positive integer such that In the latter case by testing aN we can find such that an Thus the computational interpretation of enables us to decide whether there exists such that an in other words it enables us to decide the status of the Goldbach Conjecture An example of this type showing that a constructive proof of some classical result would enable us to solve the Goldbach conjecture and by similar arguments many other hitherto open problems such as the Riemann hypothesis is called a Brouwerian example for or even a Brouwerian counterexample to the statement though it is not a counterexample in the normal sense of that word The use of the Goldbach Conjecture here is purely dramatic To avoid it we define a function classically on the set of binary sequences as follows a if an for all if an for some The argument of the preceding paragraph can then be modified to show that under our computational interpretation provides us with a procedure for calculating a for any computationally well defined binary sequence a Now the computability of the function can be expressed informally by the limited principle of omniscience LPO For each binary sequence either an for all or else there exists such that an which is generally regarded as an essentially nonconstructive principle for several reasons First its recursive interpretation There is a recursive algorithm which applied to any recursively defined binary sequence outputs if an for all and outputs if an for some is provably false within recursive function theory even with classical logic see Bridges and Richman Chapter so if we want to allow a recursive interpretation of all our mathematics then we cannot use LPO Secondly there is a model theory Kripke models in which it can be shown that LPO is not constructively derivable Bridges and Richman Chapter Why incidentally do we have the word classically in the second sentence of the preceding paragraph It is because from a constructive standpoint a is defined only for those binary sequences a for which we can decide either that an for all or else that there exists we can compute a positive integer with an in other words is a constructively well defined function on the set of all binary sequences if and only if LPO is constructively derivable The Constructive Interpretation of Logic It should by now be clear that a full blooded computational development of mathematics disallows the idealistic interpretations of disjunction and existence upon which most classical mathematics depends In order to work constructively we need to return from the classical interpretations to the natural constructive ones or to prove we must either have a proof of or have a proof of and to prove we must have both a proof of and a proof of implies a proof of is an algorithm that converts any proof of into a proof of not to prove we must show that implies there exists to prove xP we must construct an object and prove that holds for each all a proof of is an algorithm that applied to any object and to the data proving that proves that holds These BHK interpretations the name reflects their origin in the work of Brouwer Heyting and Kolmogorov can be made more precise using Kleene notion of realizability see Dummett Beeson Chapter VII What sort of things are we looking for if we are serious about developing mathematics in such a way that when a theorem asserts the existence of an object with a property then the proof of the theorem embodies algorithms for constructing and for demonstrating by whatever calculations are necessary that has the property Here are some examples of theorems each followed by an informal description of the requirements for its constructive proof For each real number either or Proof requirement An algorithm which applied to a given real number decides whether or Note that in order to make this decision the algorithm might use not only the data describing but also the data showing that is actually a real number Each nonempty subset of that is bounded above has a least upper bound Proof requirement An algorithm which applied to a set of real numbers a member of and an upper bound for computes an object and shows that is a real number shows that for each and given a real number computes an element of such that If is a continuous real valued mapping on the closed interval such that then there exists such that and Proof requirement An algorithm which applied to the function a modulus of continuity for and the values and computes an object and shows that is a real number between and and shows that If is a continuous real valued mapping on the closed interval such that then for each there exists such that and Proof requirement An algorithm which applied to the function a modulus of continuity for the values and and a positive number computes an object and shows that is a real number between and and shows that We already have reasons for doubting that A has a constructive proof If the proof requirements for can be fulfilled then given any mathematical statement we can apply our proof of to compute a rational approximation to the supremum of the set with error We can then determine whether in which case or when In the first case there exists with so we must have and therefore In the case we have Thus implies the law of excluded middle However in Bishop constructive theory of the real numbers based on Cauchy sequences with a preassigned convergence rate we can prove the following constructive least upper bound principle Let be a nonempty subset of that is bounded above Then has a least upper bound if and only if it is upper order located in the sense that for all real numbers with either is an upper bound for or else there exists with Bishop and Bridges Proposition In passing we mention an alternative development of the constructive theory of based on interval arithmetic see Chapter of Bridges and V√Æ»õƒÉ Each of statements and which are classically equivalent is a version of the Intermediate Value Theorem In these statements a modulus of continuity for is a set of ordered pairs of positive real numbers with the following two properties for each there exists such that for each and for all with we have Statement is essentially nonconstructive since it entails the essentially nonconstructive lesser limited principle of omniscience LLPO For each binary sequence with at most one term equal to either an for all even or else an for all odd Statement a weak form of can be proved constructively using an interval halving argument of a standard type The following stronger constructive intermediate value theorem which suffices for most practical purposes is proved using an approximate interval halving argument Let be a continuous real valued mapping on the closed interval such that and have opposite signs Suppose also that is locally nonzero in the sense that for each and each there exists such that and Then there exists such that and The situation of the intermediate value theorem is typical of many in constructive analysis where we find one classical theorem with several constructive versions some or all of which may be equivalent under classical logic See also for example Bridges et al There is one omniscience principle whose constructive status is less clear than that of LPO and LLPO namely Markov principle MP For each binary sequence an if it is contradictory that all the terms an equal then there exists a term equal to This principle is equivalent to a number of simple classical propositions including the following For each real number if it is contradictory that equal then in the sense we mentioned earlier For each real number if it is contradictory that equal then there exists such that xy For each one one continuous mapping if then Markov principle represents an unbounded search if you have a proof that all terms an being leads to a contradiction then by testing the terms in turn you are guaranteed to come across a term equal to but this guarantee does not extend to an assurance that you will find the desired term before the end of the universe Most practitioners of constructive mathematics view Markov principle with at least suspicion if not downright disbelief Such views are reinforced by the observation that there is a Kripke Model showing that MP is not constructively derivable Bridges and Richman Varieties of Constructive Mathematics The desire to retain the possibility of a computational interpretation is one motivation for using the constructive reinterpretations of the logical connectives and quantifiers that we gave above but it is not exactly the motivation of the pioneers of constructivism in mathematics In this section we look at some of the different approaches to constructivism in mathematics over the past years Intuitionistic Mathematics In the late nineteenth century certain individuals most notably Kronecker and Poincar√© had expressed doubts or even disapproval of the idealistic nonconstructive methods used by some of their contemporaries but it is in the polemical writings of Brouwer beginning with his Amsterdam doctoral thesis and continuing over the next forty seven years that the foundations of a precise systematic approach to constructive mathematics were laid In Brouwer philosophy known as intuitionism mathematics is a free creation of the human mind and an object exists if and only if it can be mentally constructed If one takes that philosophical stance then one is inexorably drawn to the foregoing constructive interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers for how could a proof of the impossibility of the non existence of a certain object describe a mental construction of Brouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas as is shown by the following quotation Mathematics arises when the subject of two ness which results from the passage of time is abstracted from all special occurrences The remaining empty form the relation of to of the common content of all these two nesses becomes the original intuition of mathematics and repeated unlimitedly creates new mathematical subjects quoted in Kline A modern version of Brouwer view was given by Errett Bishop Bishop The primary concern of mathematics is number and this means the positive integers We feel about number the way Kant felt about space The positive integers and their arithmetic are presupposed by the very nature of our intelligence and we are tempted to believe by the very nature of intelligence in general The development of the positive integers from the primitive concept of the unit the concept of adjoining a unit and the process of mathematical induction carries complete conviction In the words of Kronecker the positive integers were created by God However obscure Brouwer writings could be one thing was always clear for him mathematics took precedence over logic One might say as Hermann Weyl does in the following passage that Brouwer saw classical mathematics as flawed precisely in its use of classical logic without reference to the underlying mathematics According to Brouwer view and reading of history classical logic was abstracted from the mathematics of finite sets and their subsets Forgetful of this limited origin one afterwards mistook that logic for something above and prior to all mathematics and finally applied it without justification to the mathematics of infinite sets This is the Fall and original sin of set theory for which it is justly punished by the antinomies It is not that such contradictions showed up that is surprising but that they showed up at such a late stage of the game Weyl In particular this misuse of logic led to nonconstructive existence proofs which in Hermann Weyl words inform the world that a treasure exists without disclosing its location In order to describe the logic used by the intuitionist mathematician it was necessary first to analyse the mathematical processes of the mind from which analysis the logic could be extracted In Brouwer most famous pupil Arend Heyting published a set of formal axioms which so clearly characterise the logic used by the intuitionist that they have become universally known as the axioms for intuitionistic logic Heyting These axioms captured the informal BHK interpretation of the connectives and quantifiers that we gave earlier Intuitionistic mathematics diverges from other types of constructive mathematics in its interpretation of the term sequence Normally a sequence in constructive mathematics is given by a rule which determines in advance how to construct each of its terms such a sequence may be said to be lawlike or predeterminate Brouwer generalised this notion of a sequence to include the possibility of constructing the terms one by one the choice of each term being made freely or subject only to certain restrictions stipulated in advance Most manipulations of sequences do not require that they be predeterminate and can be performed on these more general free choice sequences Thus for the intuitionist a real number essentially a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers need not be given by a rule its terms are simply rational numbers successively constructed subject only to some kind of Cauchy restriction such as the following one used by Bishop xm xn Once free choice sequences are admitted into one mathematics so perhaps to one initial surprise are certain strong choice principles Let be a subset of NN where denotes the set of natural numbers and for sets A and BA denotes the set of mappings from A into and suppose that for each a NN there exists such that a From a constructive point of view this means that we have a procedure applicable to sequences that computes for any given a According to Brouwer the construction of an element of NN is forever incomplete a generic sequence a is purely extensional in the sense that at any given moment we can know nothing about a other than a finite set of its terms It follows that our procedure must be able to calculate from some finite initial sequence aN of terms of a a natural number such that a If NN is any sequence such that bk ak for then our procedure must return the same for as it does for a This means that is a continuous function of a with respect to the topology on NN given by the metric a inf ak bk for We are therefore led to the following principle of continuous choice which we divide into a continuity part and a choice part Any function from NN to is continuous If NN and for each a NN there exists such that a then there is a function NN such that a a for all a NN If and are as in then we say that is a choice function for The omniscience principles LPO and LLPO are demonstrably false under the hypotheses but MP is consistent with it Among the remarkable consequences of are the following Any function from NN or to a metric space is pointwise continuous Every mapping from a nonempty complete separable metric space to a metric space is pointwise continuous Every map from the real line to itself is pointwise continuous Let be a complete separable normed space a normed space and un a sequence of linear mappings from to such that for each unit vector of sup un exists Then there exists such that un for all and all unit vectors of Uniform boundedness principle Each of these statements appears to contradict known classical theorems However the comparison with classical mathematics should not be made superficially in order to understand that there is no real contradiction here we must appreciate that the meaning of such terms as function and even real number in intuitionistic mathematics is quite different from that in the classical setting In practice intuitionistic mathematics cannot be compared readily and directly with classical mathematics Brouwer introspection over the nature of functions and the continuum led him to a second principle which unlike that of continuous choice is classically valid This principle requires a little more background for its explanation For any set we denote by the set of all finite sequences of elements of including the empty sequence If an is in then is called the length of and is denoted by If and is a finite or infinite sequence in of length at least then we denote by the finite sequence consisting of the first terms of Note that If and for some we say that is an extension of and that is a restriction of A subset of is said to be detachable from if A detachable subset of is called a fan if it is closed under restriction for each and each if then whenever and for each the set is finite or empty where denotes the finite sequence obtained by adjoining the natural number to the terms of A path in a fan is a sequence finite or infinite such that for each applicable We say that a path is blocked by a subset if some restriction of is in if no restriction of is in we say that misses A subset of a fan is called a bar for if each infinite path of is blocked by a bar for is uniform if there exists such that each path of length is blocked by At last we can state Brouwer next principle of intuitionism the fan theorem for detachable bars FTD Every detachable bar of a fan is uniform In its classical contrapositive form FTD is known as K√∂nig Lemma if for every there exists a path of length that misses then there exists an infinite path that misses see Dummett Of course classically the condition of detachability is superfluous It is simple to construct a Brouwerian counterexample to K√∂nig Lemma Brouwer actually posited the fan theorem without the restriction of detachability of the bar Attempts to prove that more general fan theorem constructively rely on an analysis of how we could know that a subset is a bar and led Brouwer to a notion of bar induction this is discussed in Section of the entry on intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics another good reference for bar induction is van Atten We shall return to fan theorems in Section Of the many applications of Brouwer principles the most famous is his uniform continuity theorem which follows from the pointwise continuity consequences of together a form of fan theorem more general than FTD Every mapping from a compact that is complete totally bounded metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous The reader is warned once again to interpret this carefully within Brouwer intuitionistic framework and not to jump to the erroneous conclusion that intuitionism contradicts classical mathematics It is more sensible to regard the two types of mathematics as incomparable For further discussion see the entry on intuitionistic logic Unfortunately and perhaps inevitably in the face of opposition from mathematicians of such stature as Hilbert Brouwer intuitionist school of mathematics and philosophy became more and more involved in what at least to classical mathematicians appeared to be quasi mystical speculation about the nature of constructive thought to the detriment of the practice of constructive mathematics itself This unfortunate polarisation between the Brouwerians and the Hilbertians culminated in the notorious Grundlagenstreit of the details of which can be found in the Brouwer biographies by van Dalen and van Stigt Recursive Constructive Mathematics In the late the Russian mathematician A A Markov began the development of an alternative form of constructive mathematics RUSS which is essentially recursive function theory with intuitionistic logic Markov Kushner In this variety the objects are defined by means of G√∂del numberings and the procedures are all recursive the main distinction between RUSS and the classical recursive analysis developed after in the work of Turing Church and others clarified the nature of computable processes is that the logic used in RUSS is intuitionistic One obstacle faced by the mathematician attempting to come to grips with RUSS is that being expressed in the language of recursion theory it is not easily readable indeed on opening a page of Kushner excellent lectures one might be forgiven for wondering whether this is analysis or logic This remark should be tempered with reference to the two relatively readable books on classical recursive analysis by Aberth Fortunately one can get to the heart of RUSS by an axiomatic approach due to Richman see also Chapter of Bridges and Richman First we define a set to be countable if there is a mapping from a detachable subset of onto With intuitionistic logic we cannot prove that every subset of is detachable the reader is invited to provide a Brouwerian example to demonstrate this Countable subsets of in Richman axiomatic approach are the counterparts of recursively enumerable sets in the normal development of RUSS By a partial function on we mean a mapping whose domain is a subset of if the domain is itself then we call the function a total partial function on Richman approach to RUSS is based on intuitionistic logic and a single axiom of computable partial functions CPF There is an enumeration of the set of all partial functions from to with countable domains It is remarkable what can be deduced cleanly and quickly using this principle For example we can prove the following result which almost immediately shows that LLPO and hence LPO are false in the recursive setting There is a total partial function such that for each there exists at most one such that and for each total partial function there exist in such that Of more interest however are results such as the following within RUSS Specker Theorem There exists a strictly increasing sequence of rational numbers in the closed interval such that for each there exist and such that rn for all For each there exists a sequence of bounded open intervals in such that Such a sequence of intervals is called an singular cover of There exists a pointwise continuous function that is not uniformly continuous There exists a positive valued uniformly continuous function whose infimum is From a classical viewpoint these results fit into place when one realises that words such as function and real number should be interpreted as recursive function and recursive real number respectively Note that the second of the above four recursive theorems is a strong recursive counterexample to the open cover compactness property of the recursive real line and the fourth is a recursive counterexample to the classical theorem that every uniformly continuous mapping of a compact set into attains its infimum Bishop Constructive Mathematics Progress in all varieties of constructive mathematics was relatively slow throughout the next decade and a half What was needed to raise the profile of constructivism in mathematics was a top ranking classical mathematician to show that a thoroughgoing constructive development of deep analysis was possible without a commitment to Brouwer non classical principles or to the machinery of recursive function theory This need was fulfilled in with the appearance of Errett Bishop monograph Foundations of Constructive Analysis the product of an astonishing couple of years in which working in the informal but rigorous style used by normal analysts Bishop provided a constructive development of a large part of twentieth century analysis including the Stone Weierstrass Theorem the Hahn Banach and separation theorems the spectral theorem for self adjoint operators on a Hilbert space the Lebesgue convergence theorems for abstract integrals Haar measure and the abstract Fourier transform ergodic theorems and the elements of Banach algebra theory See also Bishop and Bridges Thus at a stroke he gave the lie to the commonly held view expressed so forcefully by Hilbert Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same say as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists Hilbert Not only did Bishop mathematics BISH have the advantage of readability if you open Bishop book at any page what you see is clearly recognisable as analysis even if from time to time his moves in the course of a proof may appear strange to one schooled in the use of the law of excluded middle but unlike intuitionistic or recursive mathematics it admits many different interpretations Intuitionistic mathematics recursive constructive mathematics and even classical mathematics all provide models of BISH In fact the results and proofs in BISH can be interpreted with at most minor amendments in any reasonable model of computable mathematics such as for example Weihrauch Type Two Effectivity Theory Weihrauch Bauer How is this multiple interpretability achieved At least in part by Bishop refusal to pin down his primitive notion of algorithm or in his words finite routine This refusal has led to the criticism that his approach lacks the precision that a logician would normally expect of a foundational system However this criticism can be overcome by looking more closely at what practitioners of BISH actually do as distinct from what Bishop may have thought he was doing when they prove theorems in practice they are doing mathematics with intuitionistic logic Experience shows that the restriction to intuitionistic logic always forces mathematicians to work in a manner that at least informally can be described as algorithmic so algorithmic mathematics appears to be equivalent to mathematics that uses only intuitionistic logic If that is the case then we can practice constructive mathematics using intuitionistic logic on any reasonably defined mathematical objects not just some class of constructive objects This view more or less appears to have first been put forward by Richman Taking the logic as the primary characteristic of constructive mathematics it does not reflect the primacy of mathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer Heyting Markov Bishop and other pioneers of constructivism On the other hand it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in practice Thus one might distinguish between the ontological constructivism of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive mathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental creations and the epistemological constructivism of Richman and those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its methodology based on the use of intuitionistic logic Of course the former approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter and the latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian ontology This view more or less appears to have first been put forward by Richman Taking the logic as the primary characteristic of constructive mathematics it does not reflect the primacy of mathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer Heyting Markov Bishop and other pioneers of constructivism On the other hand it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in practice Of course to do actual mathematics we need more than just intutionistic logic For Bishop the building blocks of mathematics were the positive integers see the quote from Bishop in Section above Myhill gave an axiomatic foundation for BISH based on primitive notions of number set and function Friedman dealt with intuitionistic ZF set theory and Bridges worked with a highly formalised constructive Morse set theory The two main formal underpinnings of BISH a this stage are the CZF set theory of Aczel and Rathjen and forthcoming and the type theory of Martin L√∂f For an overview see Crosilla Martin L√∂f Constructive Type Theory Before ending our tour of varieties of modern constructive mathematics we visit a fourth variety based on Per Martin L√∂f type theory ML In Martin L√∂f published his Notes on Constructive Mathematics based on lectures he had given in Europe in so his involvement with constructivism in mathematics goes back at least to the period of Bishop writing of Foundations of Constructive Analysis Martin L√∂f book is in the spirit of RUSS rather than BISH indeed its author did not have access to Bishop book until his own manuscript was finished Martin L√∂f later turned his attention to his theory of types as a foundation for Bishop style constructive mathematics Here in his own words is an informal explanation of the ideas underlying ML We shall think of mathematical objects or constructions Every mathematical object is of a certain kind or type and is always given together with its type A type is defined by describing what we have to do in order to construct an object of that type Put differently a type is well defined if we understand what it means to be an object of that type Thus for instance functions from to is a type not because we know particular number theoretic functions like the primitive recursive ones but because we think we understand the notion of number theoretic function in general Martin L√∂f In particular in this system every proposition can be represented as a type namely the type of proofs of the proposition Conversely each type determines a proposition namely the proposition that the type in question is inhabited So when we think of a certain type as a proposition we interpret the formula as is a proof of the proposition Martin L√∂f goes on to construct new types such as Cartesian products and disjoint unions from old For example the Cartesian product Œ†x A is the type of functions that take an arbitrary object of type A into an object of type In the propositions as proofs interpretation where represents a proposition the above Cartesian product corresponds to the universal proposition A Martin L√∂f distinguishes carefully between proofs and derivations a proof object is a witness to the fact that some proposition has been proved whereas a derivation is the record of the construction of a proof object Also he exercises two basic forms one dare not say types here of judgement The first is a relation between proof objects and propositions the second a property of some propositions In the first case the judgement is either one that a proof object a is a witness to a proposition A or else one that two proof objects a and are equal and both witness that A has been proved The first case of the second form of judgement states that a proposition A is well formed and the second records that two propositions A and are equal There is a careful and highly detailed set of rules for formalising ML We will not go into those here but refer the reader to other sources such as Bridges Reeves However there is one further technical matter we would like to mention the axiom of choice is derivable in ML The full axiom of choice can be stated as follows If A are inhabited sets and a subset of A such that A then there exists a choice function A such that A Now if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation then for a given A the value of the choice function will depend not only on but also on the data proving that belongs to A In general we cannot expect to produce a choice function of this sort On the other hand the BHK interpretation of is that there is an algorithm A which applied to any given A produces an element such that If A is a completely presented or in Bishop words basic set one for which no work beyond the construction of each element in the set is required to prove that the element does indeed belong to A then we might reasonably expect the algorithm A to be a choice function In Bishop style mathematics basic sets are rare is one In Martin L√∂f type theory every set is completely presented and in keeping with what we wrote above about the BHK interpretation of the axiom of choice is derivable therein In this connection we should point the reader to the Diaconescu and Goodman and Myhill proofs that the axiom of choice entails the law of excluded middle see also Problem on page of Bishop Clearly the Diaconescu Goodman Myhill theorem applies under the assumption that not every set is completely presented For an analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type theory see Martin L√∂f When actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory one often needs to equip completely presented sets types with an equivalence relation the combination being known as a setoid Mappings are then functions that respect those equivalence relations This is in close agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory of sets The dependent types of Martin L√∂f are useful for constructing subsets For instance the real numbers can be constructed using the type see Martin L√∂f Œ£x Œ†m Œ†n xm xn An element of this type is thereby a pair consisting of a convergent sequence of rationals and a proof that it is convergent A suitable equivalence relation on is defined by taking to mean xm ym The resulting setoid of real numbers is We can readily prove that and then using the type theoretic axiom of choice find a function such that However there is no reason to believe that the function respects the equivalence relations that is that holds if Every constructive proof embodies an algorithm that in principle can be extracted and recast as a computer program moreover the constructive proof is itself a verification that the algorithm is correct that is meets its specification One major advantage of Martin L√∂f formal approach to constructive mathematics is that it greatly facilitates the extraction of programs from proofs This has led to serious work on the implementation of constructive mathematics in various locations see Martin L√∂f Constable and Hayashi and Nakano Some recent implementations of type theory for proof extraction are Coq and Agda Constructive Reverse Mathematics In the Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of reverse mathematics aiming to classify mathematical theorems according to their equivalence to one of a small number of set theoretic principles Friedman This classification reveals interesting sometimes remarkable differences in proof theoretic complexity For example although the Ascoli Arzel√† theorem is used in the standard proof of Peano existence theorem for solutions of ordinary differential equations Hurewicz page a reverse mathematical analysis shows that the former is equivalent to a strictly stronger set theoretic principle than the one equivalent to Peano theorem Simpson Theorems and The standard treatise on classical reverse mathematics is Simpson Around the turn of this century Veldman Veldman in the Netherlands and Ishihara Ishihara in Japan independently initiated a programme of constructive reverse mathematics CRM based on intuitionistic rather than classical logic Note though that the first published work in the modern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman which was twenty years ahead of its time In this section of the article we describe a less formal approach to CRM in the style and framework of BISH The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in the three standard models CLASS INT and RUSS according to which principles we must and need only add to BISH in order to prove them We stress that we restrict ourselves here to informal CRM in which we take for granted the principles of function and set construction described in the first chapters of Bishop Bishop and Bridges Bridges and Richman Bridges and V√Æ»õƒÉ and we work in the informal though rigorous style of the practising analyst algebraist topologist In practice CRM splits naturally into two parts In the first of these we consider a theorem of INT or RUSS and try to find some principle valid in that model and other than itself whose addition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a constructive proof of In the second part of CRM we deal with a theorem of CLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive and we try to prove that is equivalent over BISH to one of a number of known essentially nonconstructive principles such as MP LLPO LPO or LEM For an example of this part of CRM we mention our earlier proof that the classical least upper bound principle implies and hence is equivalent to LEM Incidentally there is a strong argument for Brouwer being the first to deal with reverse mathematical ideas his Brouwerian counterexamples see the one using the Goldbach conjecture in Section above dating back to Brouwer lie squarely in the second part of CRM Even if Brouwer did not state those examples as logical equivalences but as implications of the type some nonconstructive principle it is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right hand side implied the left in such cases To illustrate the first part of CRM we now concentrate on theorems of the type BISH FT where FT is some form of Brouwer fan theorem and is a theorem of INT To do so we need to distinguish between certain types of bar for the complete binary fan the set of all finite sequences in Let be a finite or infinite binary sequence The concatenation of with another string is Œ±n Œ≤m For in we write rather than By a subset of we mean a subset of such that for some detachable subset of Every detachable subset of is a subset On the other hand by a subset of we mean a subset of with the following property there exists a detachable subset of such that and Every subset of is a subset simply take where is a detachable subset of such that holds If denotes a property of subsets of then Brouwer fan theorem for bars tells us that every bar with the property is a uniform bar We are particularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable bars already discussed in Section FTD Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform the fan theorem for bars that is bars that are subsets FTc Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform the fan theorem for bars that is bars that are subsets Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform and the full fan theorem already discussed in Section FT Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform Note that relative to BISH It is not known whether any of these implications can be reversed but Diener has shown that the negations of these four principles are equivalent over BISH Typically we want to prove that FT is equivalent over BISH to the proposition that for every set of an appropriate sort some pointwise property of the form actually holds uniformly in the form Our strategy for attacking this problem is two fold First given a set of the appropriate sort we construct a subset of such that if holds then is a bar and if is a uniform bar then holds This though is only half of the solution To prove that the implication from to implies FT we consider a subset of and construct a corresponding set such that if is a bar then holds and if holds then is a uniform bar The canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman in which is the set of values of a given uniformly continuous mapping is the set of positive real numbers and The pointwise property we consider is its uniform version being The Julian Richman results are as follows Theorem Let be uniformly continuous Then there exists a detachable subset of such that if for each then is a bar and if is a uniform bar then inf Theorem Let be a detachable subset of Then there exists a uniformly continuous such that if is a bar then for each and if inf then is a uniform bar The proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky see Julian and Richman or Bridges and Richman Chapter for details A new but equally complex proof can be found in Berger and Bridges The two Julian Richman theorems together reveal that relative to BISH the fan theorem FTD is equivalent to the positivity principle POS Each positive valued uniformly continuous function on has a positive infimum It follows that POS is derivable in INT in which the full fan theorem not just FTD is a standard principle The situation is quiet the opposite in RUSS where there exist a detachable bar of that is not uniform and a positive valued uniformly continuous function on that has infimum equal to see Chapters and of Bridges and Richman Berger and Ishihara have taken a different indirect route to establishing the equivalence of POS and FTc They establish a chain of equivalences between POS FTc and four principles of the type if there is at most one object with property then there is one such object The four unique existence principles are CIN Each descending sequence of inhabited closed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one common point has inhabited intersection Cantor intersection theorem with uniqueness MIN Each uniformly continuous real valued function on a compact metric space with at most one minimum point has a minimum point WKL Each infinite tree with at most one infinite branch has an infinite branch the weak K√∂nig lemma with uniqueness FIX Each uniformly continuous function from a compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point and with approximate fixed points has a fixed point In for example the last of these we say that a map of a metric space into itself has at most one fixed point if whenever has approximate fixed points if for each there exists such that A major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan theorem that is equivalent over BISH to the uniform continuity theorem for UCT Every pointwise continuous mapping of into is uniformly continuous the proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of the fan theorem Note that UCT is equivalent relative to BISH to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric spaces Every pointwise continuous mapping of a complete totally bounded metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous See Loeb and Bridges and Diener It follows from results of Berger that BISH UCT FTc Also Diener and Loeb have proved that However we do not know if either of these implications can be replaced by a bi implication Perhaps UCT and hence the full uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces is equivalent relative to BISH to some natural but as yet unidentified version of the fan theorem For additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse mathematics see for example Berger and Bridges Bridges Diener Diener and Loeb and Diener and Lubarsky Interested readers may pursue the topic of constructive reverse mathematics in greater detail in the following supplementary document Ishihara principle BD and the anti Specker Property Constructive Topology Constructive mathematicians have tended to concentrate their efforts on the field of analysis with considerable success witness the wealth of functional analysis developed in Bishop This does not mean that for example algebra has been sidelined from the constructive enterprise the material in the monograph by Mines et al can be regarded as a substantial algebraic counterpart to the constructive analysis carried out by Bishop Much more recently Lombardi and Quitt√© have published the first large volume of a proposed two volume work on constructive algebra However not being expert in algebra and being aware of the danger of making this article too long to hold the reader attention we choose not to discuss constructive analysis or algebra in any detail rather in the following supplementary document we turn to constructive topology describing two rather different approaches to that subject Concluding Remarks The traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the constructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical logic in order to avoid decisions such as whether or not a real number equals that cannot be made by a real computer the mathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries such as those formed by recursive function theory In contrast the route taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic logic which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible decisions This logic together with an appropriate set or type theoretic framework suffices to keep the mathematics within constructive boundaries Thus the mathematician is free to work in the natural style of an analyst algebraist Mines et al geometer topologist Bridges and V√Æ»õƒÉ Sambin forthcoming or other normal mathematician the only constraints being those imposed by intuitionistic logic As Bishop and others have shown the traditional belief promulgated by Hilbert and still widely held today that intuitionistic logic imposes such restrictions as to render the development of serious mathematics impossible is patently false large parts of deep modern mathematics can be and have been produced by purely constructive methods Moreover the link between constructive mathematics and programming holds great promise for the future implementation and development of abstract mathematics on the computer The Basics Definition of Free Logic Free logic is formal logic whose quantifiers are interpreted in the usual way that is objectually over a specified domain but whose singular terms may denote objects outside of or fail to denote at all Singular terms include proper names individual constants definite descriptions and such functional expressions as Since classical Fregean predicate logic requires that singular terms denote members of free logic is a nonclassical logic Where is as usual taken to be the class of existing things free logic may be characterized as logic the referents of whose singular terms need not exist Karel Lambert coined the term free logic as an abbreviation for logic free of existence assumptions with respect to its terms singular and general General terms are predicates Lambert was suggesting that just as classical predicate logic generalized Aristotelian logic by inter alia admitting predicates that are satisfied by no existing thing is a Martian is non self identical travels faster than light so free logic generalizes classical predicate logic by admitting singular terms that denote no existing thing Aphrodite the greatest integer the present king of France Because classical logic singular terms must denote existing things when as usual is read as there exists classical logic is unreliable in application to statements containing singular terms whose referents either do not exist or are not known to Consider for example the true statement We detect no motion of the earth relative to the ether using the ether as a singular term for the light bearing medium posited by nineteenth century physicists The reason why is true is that as we now know the ether does not exist According to classical logic however is false because it implies the existence of the ether Free logic allows such statements to be true despite the non referring singular term Indeed it allows even statements of the form the ether does not exist to be true though in classical logic which presumes that refers to an object in the quantificational domain they are self contradictory Free logic accommodates empty singular terms those that denote no member of the quantificational domain by rejecting inferences whose validity depends on the classical presumption that they must denote members of Consider for example the rule of universal instantiation specification from the premise Every in satisfies A we may infer satisfies A This rule whose formal expression is xA A is invalid in free logic for even if every object in satisfies A if does not denote a member of A may be false Here and elsewhere A is the result of replacing all occurrences of in A by individual constant if there are no such occurrences then A is just A Existential generalization the principle that from satisfies A we may infer there exists in a thing that satisfies A A xA is likewise invalid for if does not denote an object in then the truth of A does not guarantee that there exists in an object that satisfies A Though free logic rejects such classical inferences it accepts no classically invalid inferences hence it is strictly weaker than classical logic for a language with the same vocabulary To distinguish terms that denote members of from those that do not free logic often employs the one place existence predicate sometimes written simply as For any singular term is true if denotes a member of false otherwise may be either taken as primitive or in bivalent free logic with identity defined as follows df Using we can express classical logic blanket presumption that singular terms denote members of as an explicit premise for selected terms Thus we can formulate the following weaker analogs of universal instantiation xA A and existential generalization A xA which are valid in free logic Classical predicate logic presumes not only that all singular terms refer to members of the quantificational domain but also that is nonempty Free logic rejects the first of these presumptions Inclusive logic sometimes also called empty or universally free logic rejects them both Thus while inclusive logic for a language containing singular terms must be free free logics need not be inclusive Many existential assertions Px Px Px yPy are true in all nonempty domains and hence are valid in both classical logic and non inclusive free logic But since all existentially quantified formulas are false in the empty domain none are valid in inclusive logic Correlatively since all universally quantified formulas are true in the empty domain none are self contradictory in inclusive logic Even vacuously universally quantified formulas formulas of the form xA where is not free in A are true in the empty domain Hence the schema xA A where is not free in A which is valid in both classical logic and non inclusive free logic is invalid in inclusive logic Inclusive logic also invalidates some of the laws of confinement A xA where is not free in that are used for prenexing formulas giving quantifiers the widest possible scope or purifying them giving quantifiers the narrowest possible scope And in inclusive logic the formula A widely used in the theory of definite descriptions is not equivalent as it otherwise is to A A since with empty and A false the first but not the second is true Where there is need for such regularities a non inclusive free logic may be preferable to an inclusive one Yet because inclusivity frees logic from one more existential presumption many free logicians favor it Formal Systems Logics may be represented in various ways Axiom systems natural deduction systems and trees or equivalently tableaux are among the most common This section presents all three for the bivalent inclusive form of free logic known as Positive Free Logic PFL and mentions some variants For the meaning of the term positive in this context see Section PFL is formulated in a first order language without sentence letters or function symbols whose primitive logical operators are negation not the conditional if then the universal quantifier for all identity and the others being defined as usual We assume for the sake of definiteness that the formulas of are closed contain no unquantified variables and that they may be vacuously quantified have the form xA or xA where does not occur free in A An occurrence of a variable is quantified if it lies within the scope of an operator such as or that binds that variable otherwise it is free Axiom Systems PFL may be axiomatized with modus ponens as the sole inference rule by adding the following schemas to the tautologies of classical propositional logic A xA A xA xB xA if A is an axiom xA A xE A note on conventions involving variables once again A is the result of replacing all occurrences of in A by individual constant If there are no such occurrences then A is just A In the variable is not free in A since otherwise A would be an open formula and formulas of are closed However may be free in A or in and in A in and and are special axioms for free logic The others are classical modifies the classical principle xA A by using to restrict specification stipulates in effect that the quantifiers range over all objects that satisfy that they range only over objects that satisfy Omitting and replacing with yields classical logic To obtain a non inclusive free logic we may add to the axiom xE or any axiom of the form xT such that for any term is a tautology For languages containing the identity predicate we also need A A where A is the result of replacing one or more occurrences of in A by and either if all self identity statements including those whose singular term is empty are to be true or if not see Sections and below If is defined in terms of the identity predicate as indicated in Section then takes the form xA A and is redundant and may be omitted cannot be defined without the identity predicate Meyer Bencivenga and Lambert Free logic can be formalized without either or remain unchanged but and are replaced respectively by xA A yA xA like restricts specification to objects within but it uses a quantifier instead of to do so The quantifier permutation axiom is redundant in the presence of the identity axioms but as Fine proved in is independent of the other axioms The formulas used in the axiom systems discussed so far are closed but some free logics allow open formulas formulas that contain free variables These logics follow one of two conventions for variable assignments Those that assign to each free variable a member of are called logics those that do not are called logics The following specification rule is valid in logics but not in logics xA A Here A is the result of replacing every occurrence of the variable in A by a variable that is free for in A Conversely the following substitution rule is valid in logics but not in logics A A But since this article employs closed formulas the distinction between and logics may here be ignored See Williamson for an illuminating discussion of problems engendered by permitting open formulas in inclusive logics Natural Deduction Rules PFL can also equivalently be formulated in a natural deduction system The introduction and elimination rules for the operators of propositional logic and identity are as usual The quantifier introduction and elimination rules are restricted by use of the predicate as follows I Given a derivation of A from where is new and does not occur in A discharge and infer xA From xA and infer A I From A and infer xA Given xA and a derivation of a formula from A where is new and does not occur in either A or discharge A and infer from xA The variable need not be free in A in which case A is just A may either be taken as primitive in which case it requires no additional rules or defined in terms of the identity predicate as in Section For non inclusive logic we may add a rule that introduces xE Tree Rules Jeffrey style tree rules Jeffrey for PFL can be obtained by replacing the classical rules for existentially and universally quantified formulas with the following Existential Rule If xA appears unchecked on an open path check it and if is free in A choose a new individual constant and list both and A at the bottom of every open path beneath xA and if is not free in A write A at the bottom of every open path beneath xA Universal Rule If xA appears on an open path then if is free in A then where is an individual constant that occurs in a formula on that path or a new individual constant if there are none on the path split the bottom of every open path beneath xA into two branches writing at the bottom of the first branch and A at the bottom of the second and if is not free in A write A at the bottom of every open path beneath xA For languages that do not allow vacuous quantification clause ii can in each case be omitted Non inclusive free logic needs an additional rule that introduces for some new individual constant if a path does not already contain a formula of this form Semantics Semantics for free logics differ in how they assign truth values to atomic formulas that are empty termed contain at least one empty singular term There are three general approaches Negative semantics require all empty termed atomic formulas to be false Positive semantics allow some empty termed atomic formulas not of the form to be true and Neutral or nonvalent semantics require all empty termed atomic formulas not of the form to be truth valueless Negative Semantics A negative semantics is a bivalent semantics on which all empty termed atomic formulas including identity statements are false The inclusive version presented here makes only minimal adjustments to classical semantics to allow for non denoting terms Let the language be defined as in Section Then a negative inclusive model for is a pair I where is a possibly empty set the domain and I is an interpretation function that assigns referents to individual constants and extensions to predicates such that for each individual constant of either I or I is undefined and for each place predicate of I Dn Dn is the set of tuples of members of a tuple of an object being just itself Given a model I we recursively define a valuation function that assigns truth values to formulas as follows tn I I tn are all defined and I I tn I otherwise I and I are both defined and I I otherwise I is defined otherwise A A otherwise A A or otherwise xA for all A where is any individual constant not in A and is the valuation function on the model I such that I is just like I except that I otherwise The metalinguistic symbol means if and only if A logic adequate to this semantics may be axiomatized by making three changes to the axioms of PFL The first is to add the axiom A tn ti where and is any primitive place predicate including This expresses the convention that an atomic formula cannot be true unless its terms refer Second because all empty termed identity statements are false on a negative semantics is invalid and must be replaced by Third since A and together imply may be omitted The resulting logic is known as NFL Negative Free Logic For languages with function symbols negative free logic requires in addition this axiom of strictness tn ti where which assures that a function has a value only if each of its arguments does Because of its unusual treatment of identity negative free logic validates the equivalence This equivalence is sometimes taken as a definition of Identity statements in negative free logic thus have existential implications This may be problematic in certain contexts According to Shapiro and Weir for example use of such an existential notion of identity sullies the epistemic innocence of some recent efforts to base neo logicist philosophies of mathematics on free logic Negative free logic is also peculiar in that it validates the principle of indiscernibility of nonexistents A A where A is the result of replacing one or more occurrences of in A by Positive Semantics Positive semantics allow some empty termed atomic formulas not of the form to be true They are typically bivalent though there are variants that allow truth value gaps or extra truth values Only bivalent semantics are considered in this section Positive semantics treat formulas of the form as true whether or not is empty Hence they validate which affirms all self identity statements not merely the weaker which affirms only self identities between nonempty terms Like negative semantics some positive semantics require each singular term to denote either a member of or nothing at all But then when a term fails to denote the truth value of an atomic formula containing it cannot as usual be a function of its denotation and the formula must be evaluated in some nonstandard way To avoid such irregularity and yet permit empty termed formulas to be true other positive semantics allow singular terms to denote and predicates to be satisfied by nonmembers of These nonmembers are collected into a second or outer domain Do in contrast to which is described as the inner domain The result is a dual domain semantics Positive semantics with dual domains are generally the simplest The members of the outer domain Do typically represent non existing things Depending on the application these may be theoretical or ideal entities error objects in computer science fictional objects merely possible or even impossible objects and so on Some authors make a subset of Do which is the convention throughout this article others make the two disjoint In a bivalent dual domain semantics each singular term denotes an object in Do though possibly not in Thus though not Do may empty Predicates are assigned extensions from Do and the truth values of atomic formulas whether empty termed or not are computed in the usual Tarskian fashion an atomic formula is true if and only if the tuple of objects denoted by its singular terms taken in order is a member of the predicate extension Identity statements are no exception Statements of the form are true if and only if and denote the same object Hence even if empty termed they may be true More formally a dual domain model for a language of the sort defined in Section is a triple Do I where is a possibly empty inner domain Do is a nonempty outer domain such that Do and I is an interpretation function such that for every individual constant of I Do and for every place predicate of I Don Given a model Do I the valuation function assigns truth values to atomic and quantified formulas as follows tn I I tn I otherwise I I otherwise I otherwise xA for all A where is not in A and is the valuation function on the model Do I such that I is just like I except that I otherwise The clauses for and are the same as in negative free logic PFL with classical identity that is the logic axiomatized by is sound and complete with respect to this semantics Leblanc and Thomason Dual domain semantics have been criticized as ontologically extravagant In response some authors have advocated single domain positive semantics which assign no denotation to empty singular terms In such semantics empty termed atomic formulas require unconventional treatment Typically such semantics determine the truth values of atomic formulas in two different ways a Tarksi style calculation for formulas whose terms all refer and a separate truth value assignment for empty termed atomic formulas The details however tend to get complicated Antonelli for example advocated such a single domain free logic which he called proto semantics but more recently he has characterized all semantics for positive free logic as somewhat artificial and has questioned the logical character of free quantification in general Neutral Semantics Neutral semantics make all empty termed atomic formulas not of the form truth valueless Truth valueless formulas are often said to have truth value gaps Neutral semantics are of two types ordinary neutral semantics which provide conventions for calculating the truth values of complex formulas directly from their components even when there are empty terms and supervaluational semantics which calculate the truth values of complex formulas by considering all the values that their components could have if their empty terms had referents Ordinary neutral semantics will be considered in this section supervaluations in Section The uniform policy of making all empty termed atomic formulas truth valueless has the advantages of plausibility and simplicity at the atomic level but it complicates the evaluation of complex formulas How are the logical operators to function when some of the values on which they usually operate are absent Some cases are fairly clear The negation of a truth valueless formula for example is generally taken to be truth valueless But If A is true and truth valueless is A false or truth valueless If A is false and truth valueless is A true or truth valueless Let A where is free in be true of some but not all members of and be closed and truth valueless Clearly this open formula is either truth valueless of every object in or truth valueless of some and false of others In either case is xA truth valueless or false At one extreme we might want the operators to generate as many plausible truth values as possible in order to validate as many classically valid formulas as we can At the other one might arrange things so that all empty termed formulas are truth valueless which would produce a very weak logic Lehman But however we choose many formulas that are valid in both classical predicate logic and the usual forms of free logic indeed even in propositional logic will become invalid The law of noncontradiction for example A A is truth valueless whenever A is unless we make negations of truth valueless statements true and hence becomes invalid Of course this law and many other standard logical principles remain weakly valid not false on any model and it is possible to construct a logic based on weak validity rather than ordinary validity But because any such logic will still be weaker than classical logic and because its theorems need not even be true most logicians reject this strategy For more on neutral free logic see Lehman and pp Supervaluations Neutral semantics can be made to validate all the theorems of standard free logics by augmenting them with supervaluations Supervaluations were first formalized by van Fraassen The version presented here is a variant of Bencivenga approach and The fundamental idea is this when empty terms deprive a formula of truth value supervaluational semantics nevertheless accounts it true or false if all possible ways of assigning referents to those terms agree in making it true or false This strategy restores validity to many principles that would lose it in an ordinary neutral semantics The following instance of the law of noncontradiction Pt Pt for example is truth valueless when is nondenoting assuming an ordinary neutral semantics that makes the negation of a truth valueless formula truth valueless Hence in such a semantics the law itself is invalid Yet were we to assign a referent to that referent would either be in the extension of or not If it were then Pt would be true If it were not then Pt would be false In either case Pt Pt would be true Thus since all possible ways of assigning referents to agree in making Pt Pt true we should count Pt Pt itself as true In this way the law of noncontradiction can be preserved More explicitly a supervaluation begins with a neutral model with a single possibly empty domain We then construct the set of completions of These may be regarded as bivalent dual domain positive models whose inner domain is the domain of but which also have an outer domain Do to provide referents for the empty terms In each completion singular terms that are nonempty in retain their referents and those that are empty in denote a member of Do For each place predicate the extension of is a subset of Don and a superset of extension in From these completions we now construct a supervaluation A supervaluation of is a partial assignment of truth values to formulas that makes a formula true if all completions of make it true false if they all make it false and truth valueless if they disagree A formula is valid on a supervaluational semantics if and only if it is true on all supervaluations This semantics validates all and only the theorems of PFL Bencivenga Morscher Simons pp Supervaluations employ what Bencivenga calls a counterfactual theory of truth an empty termed statement is true if it would be true on any assignment of referents to its empty terms This has struck many critics as simply false Moreover the logic itself leaves much to be desired For one thing supervaluational consequence is too strong Thus for example although the formula Pt is quite properly not valid on a supervaluational semantics nevertheless since is true on every supervaluation on which Pt is true the sequent derivability statement Pt is improperly semantically valid Therefore although PFL is sound on supervaluational semantics and every semantically valid formula is a theorem of PFL not all semantically valid sequents are provable in PFL In fact supervaluational consequence is not axiomatizable by any extension of free logic This follows from a result of Woodruff who has shown that supervaluational semantics has many of the undesirable properties of second order semantics Jerry A Fodor and Ernest Lapore argue furthermore that the completions needed to construct supervaluations are not meaning preserving Hence they conclude two alleged advantages of supervaluations that they explain the meaningfulness of sentences with truth value gaps and that they allow us to preserve classical logic are illusory Finally since supervaluations are built from completions that are in effect positive dual domain models we may wonder whether the detour through supervaluations is worth the trouble since positive dual domain models alone are simpler and more adequate to PFL Generic Anomalies While problems noted above are specific to particular forms of free logic there are anomalies that infect all or nearly all forms This section considers three a cluster of problems related to the application of primitive predicates to empty terms the failure of substitutivity salva veritate of co referential expressions and the inability of free logic to express sufficient conditions for existence Problems with Primitive Predicates In classical logic and in positive free logic any substitution instance of a valid formula or form of inference is itself a valid formula or form of inference But in negative or neutral free logic this is not the case A substitution instance is the result of replacing primitive non logical symbols by possibly more complex ones of the same semantic type place predicates with open formulas in variables and individual constants with singular terms each occurrence of the same primitive symbol being replaced by the same possibly complex symbol The replacement of an occurrence of a primitive place predicate in some formula by an open formula A with free variables xn is performed as follows where tn are the individual constants or variables immediately following in that occurrence replace tn in by A ti xi the result of replacing xi by ti in A for each Let for example be a primitive one place predicate Then if the semantics is negative Pt is valid But now consider the substitution instance Pt in which the open formula Px is substituted for This substitution instance is false when is empty Hence valid formulas may have invalid substitution instances The same holds for ordinary neutral semantics that make conditionals true whenever their consequents are true In a negative semantics moreover the truth value of an empty termed statement depends arbitrarily on our choice of primitive predicates Consider for example a negative free logic interpreted over a domain of people that takes as primitive the one place predicate A meaning is an adult and defines is a minor by this schema Mt df At For any non denoting name At is false in this theory hence Mt is true If we take is a minor as primitive instead the truth values of At and Mt are reversed But why should truth values depend on primitiveness in this way Positive semantics avoid these anomalies But if bivalent in application they force us to assign truth values to empty termed formulas in some other way often without sufficient reason Consider for example these three formulas all of which contain the empty singular term where is the division sign Assuming a bivalent positive semantics which ones should we make true and which false Since the semantics is positive is automatically true One might argue further that since expresses a relationship weaker than and since is true should be true as well But that is merely to mimic with empty terms an inference pattern that holds for denoting terms To what extent is such mimicry justified Suppose we do decide to make true should we therefore make false There are no non arbitrary criteria for answering such questions To a large extent of course the answers don matter There are no facts here any consistent convention will do But that just the problem Some convention is needed and establishing one can be a lot of bother for nothing Substitutivity Failures Classical predicate logic has the desirable feature that co extensive open formulas may be substituted for one another in any formula salva veritate without changing that formula truth value Open formulas A and in free variables xn are coextensive if and only if xn A is true But as Lambert noted in this principle fails for nearly all free logics with identity Consider for example the formula where is empty which is an instance of the open formula Now is coextensive with both and since all three formulas are satisfied by all members of Hence if co extensive open formulas could be exchanged salva veritate and would have the same truth value as But on nearly all free logics this is not the case Positive free logic and the supervaluations described in Section make true and false negative free logic makes false and true and any ordinary neutral free logic whose conditionals are true whenever their antecedents are false makes truth valueless and true Many find this troubling because since Frege it has been widely held that extensions of complex linguistic expressions should be functions of the extensions of their components so that co extensive components should be exchangeable without affecting the extension of the whole and the extension of a formula or statement is a truth value One possible response is to reject Leeb develops for a version of PFL a dual domain semantics in which the extensions of formulas are abstract states of affairs In this semantics co referential open sentences are exchangeable not salve veritate but as he puts it salve extensione that is the exchange does not alter the state of affairs designated by the statement in which it occurs But Leeb state of affairs semantics is so complex that it may discourage application Those who wish to retain may be consoled by the following observation though substitutivity salve veritate of co extensive open formulas fails for nearly all free logics a related but weaker principle the substitutivity salve veritate of co comprehensive open formulas is valid for positive free logics Open formulas A and in free variables xn are co comprehensive if every assignment of denotations in the outer domain Do to xn satisfies A if and only if it satisfies Among the open formulas mentioned in the previous paragraph for example and are co comprehensive in a dual domain positive free logic being satisfied by all members of Do but is not co comprehensive with them since it is satisfied only by the members of Unlike co extensiveness however co comprehensiveness is not expressible in the language of PFL But it becomes expressible with the introduction of quantifiers over the outer domain a strategy considered in Section Inexpressibility of Existence Conditions Whatever thinks exists Any necessary being exists That which is immediately known exists such statements of sufficient conditions for existence are prominent in metaphysical debates But somewhat surprisingly they are not expressible in free logic Their apparent form is A But because the universal quantifier ranges just over which is also the extension of this form is valid in free logic as it is in classical logic with expressed as No statement of this form not even all impossible things exist can be false Hence on free logic all such statements are equally devoid of content Argument evaluation suffers as a result Consider for example the obviously valid inference Its natural formalization in free logic is Ti Tx But this form is invalid To obtain the conclusion we must first deduce Ti by specification from the second premise and then use modus ponens with the first But since the logic is free specification requires the question begging premise A remedy is not to be found in free logic alone but once again quantification over the outer domain of a dual domain semantics may help see Section Some Applications This section considers applications of free logic in theories of definite descriptions languages that allow partial or non strict functions logics with Kripke semantics logics of fiction and logics that are in a certain sense Meinongian Free logic has also found application elsewhere most prominently in theories of predication programming languages set theory logics of presupposition with neutral semantics and definedness logics For more on these and other applications see Lambert and Lehman pp and Nolt pp Theories of Definite Descriptions The earliest and most extensive applications of free logic have been to the theory of definite descriptions A definite description is a phrase that may be expressed in the form the such that A where A is an open formula with only free Formally this is written using a special logical operator the definite description operator as ŒπxA Contra Russell free logic treats definite descriptions not as merely apparent singular terms in formulas whose logical form is obtainable only by elaborate contextual definitions but as genuine singular terms Thus like an individual constant ŒπxA may be attached to predicates and under appropriate conditions substituted for variables For any object in the domain ŒπxA denotes if and only if among all objects in and only satisfies A If in there is more than one object satisfying A or none ŒπxA is empty The description operator therefore obeys Lambert Law LL ŒπxA A free in A Adding LL to the free logic defined by and gives the minimal free definite description theory MFD MFD is the core of virtually all free description theories which therefore differ only in the additional principles they endorse There is plenty of room for variation for MFD fails to specify truth conditions for atomic formulas including identities when they contain empty descriptions and there are many ways to do it Making all atomic formulas containing empty descriptions false yields a negative free description theory axiomatizable by adding LL to NFL Burge Lambert The result is essentially Bertrand Russell theory of definite descriptions but with the description operator taken as primitive rather than contextually defined The simplest positive free description theory makes all identities between empty terms true Known as it may be axiomatized by adding LL and to PFL is akin to Gottlob Frege theory of definite descriptions but whereas Frege chose a single arbitrary existing object to serve as the conventional referent for empty singular terms makes this object non existent is readily modeled in a dual domain positive semantics with just one object in the outer domain On all empty descriptions are intersubstitutable salve veritate But this result is subject to counterexamples in ordinary language This statement The golden mountain is a possible object for instance is true while this one The set of all non self membered sets is a possible object is false though each applies the same predicate phrase is a possible object to an empty description Thus we may prefer a more flexible positive free description theory on which identities between empty terms may be false The literature presents a surprising diversity of these Lambert Bencivenga pp Lehman pp Logics with Partial or Non Strict Functions Some logics employ primitive place function symbols symbols that combine with singular terms to form a complex singular term Thus for example the plus sign is a two place function symbol that when placed between say and forms a complex singular term that denotes the number five Similarly is a one place function symbol that when placed after term denoting a number forms a complex singular term that denotes that number square Semantically the extension of a function symbol is a function whose arguments are members of the quantificational domain and the resulting complex term denotes the result of applying that function to the referents of the component singular terms taken in the order listed Since classical logic requires every singular term including those formed by function symbols to refer to to an object in for each such function symbol it requires that xn xn Hence classical logic prohibits primitive function symbols whose extensions are partial functions functions whose value is for some arguments undefined Such for example is the binary division sign since when placed between two numerals the second of which is it forms an empty singular term Similarly the limit function symbol lim yields an empty singular term when applied to the name of a non coverging sequence Classical logic can accomodate function symbols for partial functions via elaborate contextual definitions But then as with Russellian definite descriptions the form in which these function symbols are usually written is not their logical form Free logic provides a more elegant solution Because it allows empty singular terms symbols for partial functions may simply be taken as primitive In applications of free logic involving partial functions the existence predicate is often replaced by the postfix definedness predicate For any singular term is true if and only if has some definite value in Thus for example the formula is false While some writers Feferman distinguish from the literature as a whole does not and is often merely a syntactic variant of In addition to partial functions positive free logics can also readily handle non strict functions A non strict function is a function that may yield a value even if not all of its arguments are defined The binary function such that for instance can yield a value even if the term is empty So for example the formula can be regarded as true Logics for non strict functions must be positive because in a negative or neutral logic empty termed atomic formulas such as cannot be true Free logics involving non strict functions find application in some programming languages Gumb Gumb and Lambert Such logics may employ a dual domain semantics in which the referents of empty functional expressions such as are regarded as error objects objects that correspond in the running of a program to error messages Thus for example an instruction to calculate might return the value but an instruction to calculate would return an error message Logics with Kripke Semantics Kripke semantics for quantified modal logics tense logics deontic logics intuitionistic logics and so on are often free This is because they index truth to certain objects that we shall call worlds and usually some things that we have names for do not exist in some of these worlds Worlds may be conceived in various ways they may for example be understood as possible universes in alethic modal logic times or moments in tense logic permissible conditions in deontic logic or epistemically possible states of knowledge in intuitionistic logic Associated with each world is a domain Dw of objects intuitively the set of objects that exist at An object may exist in or at more than one world but need not exist in all Thus for example Kripke semantics for tense logic represents the fact that Bertrand Russell existed at one time but exists no longer by Russell being a member of the domains of certain worlds that is times specifically portions of the last two centuries but not others the present for example or all future times Two natural assumptions are made here that the same object may exist in more than one world this is the assumption of transworld identity and that some singular terms proper names in particular refer to not only to an object at a given world but to that same object at every world Such terms are called rigid designators Any logic that combines rigid designators with quantifiers over the domains of worlds in which their referents do not exist must be free Kripke semantics gives predicates different extensions in different worlds Thus for example the extension of the predicate is a philosopher was empty in all worlds times before the dawn of civilization and more recently has varied For rigidly designating terms this raises the question of how to evaluate atomic formulas at worlds in which their referents do not exist Is the predicate is a philosopher satisfied for example by Russell in worlds times in which he does not exist times such as the present The general answers given to such questions determine whether a Kripke semantics is positive negative or neutral For negative or neutral semantics the extension at of an place predicate is a subset of Dwn An atomic formula can be true at only if all its singular terms have referents in Dw if not it is false in negative semantics or truth valueless in neutral semantics In a positive semantics atomic formulas that are empty termed at may nevertheless be true at Predicates are usually interpreted over the union of domains of all the worlds which functions as a kind of outer domain for each world so that the extension of an place predicate at a world is a subset of Un Some applications however require predicates to be true of and singular terms to be capable of denoting objects that exist in no world If so we may collect these objects into an outer domain that is a superset of They might be fictional objects timeless Platonic objects impossible objects or the like Quantified formulas like all formulas are true or false only relative to a world Thus xA for example is true at a world if and only if some object in Dw satisfies A Except in intuitionistic logic where it has a specialized interpretation the universal quantifier is interpreted similarly xA is true at if and only if all objects in Dw satisfy A Kripke semantics often specify that for each Dw is nonempty so that the resulting free logic is non inclusive but we shall not do so Any of various free modal or tense logics can be formalized by adding to a language of the sort defined in Section the sentential operator If A is a formula so is A In alethic modal logic this operator is read it is necessarily the case that More generally it means it is true in all accessible worlds that where accessibililty from a given world is a different relation for different modalities possibility for alethic logics permissibility for deontic logics various temporal relations for tense logics and so on A typical bivalent Kripke model for such a language consists of a set of worlds a binary accessibility relation defined on that set an assignment to each world of a domain Dw an outer domain Do of objects which typically is either or a superset thereof and a two place interpretation function I that assigns denotations at worlds to individual constants and extensions at worlds to predicates For each individual constant and world I Do In such a model a singular term is a rigid designator if and only if for all worlds and I I For every place predicate I Dwn if the semantics is negative or neutral if it is positive I Don Truth values at the worlds of a model are assigned by a two place valuation function where A is read the truth value assigns to formula A at world as follows tn I I tn I otherwise I I otherwise I Dw otherwise A A otherwise A A or otherwise A for all such that wRu A otherwise xA for any Dw A where is not in A and is the valuation function for the model just like except that its interpretation function I is such that for each world I otherwise Under the stipulations that admissible models make all individual constants rigid designators and that I Don the standard free logic PFL together with the modal axioms and rules appropriate to whatever structure we assign to is sound and complete on this semantics Modal semantics thus defined call for free logic whenever worlds are allowed to have differing domains that is whenever we may have worlds and such that Du Dw For in that case there must be an object that exists in one of these domains let it be Dw but not the other so that any singular term that rigidly designates must be empty at world Hence which is self contradictory in classical logic must be true at world Such a semantics also requires free logic when Do contains objects not in for in that case rigid designators of these objects are empty in all worlds Finally this semantics calls for inclusive logic if any world has an empty domain Thus given this semantics the only way to make the resulting logic unfree is to require that domains be fixed that all worlds have the same domain that be non empty and that Do Just this trio of requirements was in effect proposed by Saul Kripke in his ground breaking paper on modal logic as one of two strategies for retaining classical quantification The other more draconian strategy was to allow differing domains but ban individual constants and treat open formulas as if they were universally quantified But such fixed domain semantics validate the implausible formula which asserts that everything exists necessarily and the equally implausible Barcan formula A xA named for Ruth Barcan later Ruth Barcan Marcus who discussed it as early as the late To see its implausibility consider this instance If everything is necessarily a product of the big bang then necessarily everything is a product of the big bang It may well be true that everything in the actual world is necessarily a product of the big bang that nothing in this world would have existed without it But it does not seem necessary that everything is a product of the big bang for other universes are possible in which things that do not exist in the actual world have other ultimate origins Because of the restrictiveness and implausibility of fixed domain semantics many modal logicians loosen Kripke strictures and adopt free logics We may also drop the assumption that singular terms are rigid designators and thus allow nonrigid designators On the semantics considered here these are singular terms such that for some worlds and I I Definite descriptions understood attributively are the best examples Thus the description the oldest person designates different people at different times worlds and no one at times before people existed worlds at which I is undefined Nonrigid designators if empty at some worlds require free logics even with fixed domains Thus classical logic with nonrigid designators is possible only if we require for each singular term that at each world denotes some object in Dw On some semantics for nonrigid designators the quantifier rule must differ from that given above and other adjustments must be made For details see Garson Cocchiarella Schweitzer and Simons Intuitionistic logic too has a Kripke semantics though special valuation clauses are needed for and in order to accommodate the special meanings these operators have for intuitionists and is generally not used The usual first order intuitionistic logic the Heyting predicate calculus HPC also called the intuitionistic predicate calculus has the theorem and hence is not free But intuitionists admit the existence only of objects that can in some sense be constructed while classical mathematicians posit a wider range of objects Therefore users of HPC cannot legitimately name all the objects that classical mathematicians can Worse they cannot legitimately name objects whose constructibility has yet to be determined Yet some Kripke style semantics for HPC do allow use of names for such objects semantically names of objects that exist at worlds accessible from the actual world but not at the actual world itself Some such semantics though intended for HPC have turned out unexpectedly not to be adequate for HPC An obvious fix advocated by Posy is to adopt a free intuitionistic logic For more on this issue see Nolt Logics of Fiction Because fictions use names that do not refer to literally existing things free logic has sometimes been employed in their analysis So long as we engage in the pretense of a story however there is no special need for it It is true for example in Tolkien The Lord of the Rings that Gollum hates the sun from which we can legitimately infer that in the story there exists something that hates the sun Thus quantifiers may behave classically so long as we consider only what occurs and what exists in the story The general logic of fiction however is often regarded as nonclassical for two reasons a story may be inconsistent and hence require a paraconsistent logic and the objects a story describes are typically maybe always incomplete that is the story does not determine for each such object and every property whether or not has The picture changes however when we distinguish what is true in the story from what is literally true For this purpose logics of fiction often deploy a sentence operator that may be read in the story Here we shall use Sx to mean in the story where is to be replaced by the name of a specific story Anything within the scope of this operator is asserted to be true in the named story what is outside its scope is to be understood literally For a summary of theories of what it means to be true in a story see Woods With this operator the statement In the story The Lord of the Rings Gollum hates the sun may be formalized as follows SThe Lord of the Rings Gollum hates the sun The statement that in The Lord of the Rings something hates the sun is SThe Lord of the Rings hates the sun This second statement follows from the first even though Gollum does not literally exist But it does not follow that there exists something such that it in The Lord of the Rings hates the sun xSThe Lord of the Rings hates the sun and indeed that statement is not true for literally Gollum does not exist Since the sun however exists both literally and in the story the statement xSThe Lord of the Rings Gollum hates is true and follows by free existential generalization from SThe Lord of the Rings Gollum hates the sun together with the true premise the sun Thus free logic may play a role in reasoning that mixes fictional and literal discourse Terms for fictional entities also occur in statements that are entirely literal making no mention of what is true in the story Consider for example the statement Gollum is more famous than G√∂del Mark Sainsbury ch holds that reference failure invariably makes such statements false and hence that they are best represented in a negative free logic Others however including Orlando and Dumitru and Kroon question Sainsbury treatment maintaining that statements like are both atomic and true If so they require a positive free logic The logic must be free because it deals with an empty singular term and it must be positive because only on a positive semantics can empty termed atomic statements be true One must still decide however whether the name Gollum is to be understood as having no referent or as having a referent that does not exist If Gollum has no referent then might be handled by a single domain positive semantics But that semantics would have to treat atomic formulas non standardly it could not as usual stipulate that is true just in case the pair Gollum G√∂del is a member of the extension of the predicate is more famous than for if there is no Gollum there is no such pair On such a semantics Gollum is more famous than G√∂del would not imply that something is more famous than G√∂del If on the other hand terms such as Gollum refer to non existent objects then those objects could inhabit the outer domain of a dual domain positive free logic If so atomic formulas have their standard truth conditions is true just in case Gollum G√∂del is a member of the extension of is more famous than Moreover if we allow quantifiers over that outer domain then Something is more famous than G√∂del where the quantifier ranges over the outer domain does follow from Gollum is more famous than G√∂del though There literally exists something more famous than G√∂del where the quantifier ranges over the inner domain does not Meinongian logics of fiction employ this strategy Meinongian Logics Alexius Meinong is best known for his view that some objects that do not exist nevertheless have being His name has been associated with various developments in logic Some free logicians use it to describe any dual domain semantics For others Meinongian logic is something much more elaborate a rich theory of all the sorts of objects we can think about possible or impossible abstract or concrete literal or fictional complete or incomplete In this section the term is used to describe logics stronger than the first type but possibly weaker than the second positive free logics with an extra set of quantifiers that range over the outer domain of a dual domain semantics Whether such logics can legitimately be considered free is controversial On older conceptions free logic forbids any quantification over non existing things see Pa≈õniczek and Lambert reply in Morscher and Hieke pp But by anybody definition Meinongian logics in the sense intended here at least contain free logics when the inner domain is interpreted as the set of existing things Moreover on the strictly semantic definition used in this article Section which is also that of Lehman whether the members of exist is irrelevant to the question of whether a logic is free For a defense of this definition see Nolt pp Historically quantification over domains containing objects that do not exist has been widely dismissed as ontologically irresponsible Quine famously maintained that existence is just what an existential quantifier expresses Yet nothing forces us to interpret existential quantification over every domain as expressing existence or being of any sort Semantically an existential quantifier on a variable is just a logical operator that takes open formulas on into truth values the value is if and only if the open formula is satisfied by at least one object in the quantifier domain That the objects in the domain have or lack any particular ontological status is a philosophical interpretation of the formal semantics Alex Orenstein argues that existential is a misnomer and that we should in general call such quantifiers particular That suggestion is followed in the remainder of this section Quantifiers ranging over the outer domain of a dual domain semantics are called outer quantifiers and those ranging over the inner domain inner quantifiers If the inner particular quantifier is interpreted to mean there exists and the members of the outer domain are possibilia then the outer particular quantifier may mean something like there is possible a thing such that or for at least one possible thing We shall use the generalized product symbol for the outer universal quantifier and the generalized sum symbol for its particular dual This notation enables us to formalize for example the notoriously puzzling but obviously true statement Some things don exist Routley as Œ£x Since in a dual domain semantics all singular terms denote members of the outer domain the logic of outer quantifiers is not free but classical With as primitive the free inner quantifiers can be defined in terms of the classical outer ones as follows xA df Œ†x A xA df Œ£x A The outer quantifiers however cannot be defined in terms of the inner Logics with both inner and outer quantifiers have various applications They enable us for example to formalize substantive sufficient conditions for existence and hence adequately express the argument of Section as follows Ti Œ†x Tx This form is valid The co comprehensiveness of open formulas A and in free variables xn see Section can likewise be formalized as Œ†xn A Richard Grandy theory of definite descriptions holds that ŒπxA ŒπxB is true if and only if A and are co comprehensive and thus is readily expressible in a Meinongian logic Free logics with outer quantifiers have also been employed in logics that are Meinongian in the richer sense of providing a theory of objects including in some cases fictional objects that is inspired by Meinong work Routley and Parsons Jacquette Pa≈õniczek Priest and pp History Inclusive logic was conceived and formalized before free logic per se was Thus since inclusive logic with singular terms is de facto free the inventors of inclusive logics were perhaps unwittingly the inventors of free logic Bertrand Russell suggested the idea of an inclusive logic in Andrezej Mostowski seems to have been among the first to formalize such a logic but see Morscher and Simons note Theodore Hailperin Czeslaw Lejewski and Quine made important early contributions It was Quine who dubbed such logics inclusive Henry Leonard was the first to develop a free logic per se though he used a defective definition of Karel Lambert began his prolific series of contributions to the field in critiquing Leonard definition and then coining the term free logic in The early systems of free logic were positive Negative free logic was developed by Rolf Schock in a series of papers during the culminating in Timothy Smiley suggested the idea of a neutral free logic in but the first thoroughgoing treatment appeared in Lehman Supervaluations were described in Mehlberg pp as a device for handling not neutral free logic but vagueness But their formalization and application to free logic began with van Fraassen in which the term supervaluation was introduced Dual domain semantics were discussed in lectures by Lambert Nuel Belnap and others as early as the late but it appears that Church and Cocchiarella were the first published accounts Much of the debate about identity in recent decades has been about personal identity and specifically about personal identity over time but identity generally and the identity of things of other kinds have also attracted attention Various interrelated problems have been at the centre of discussion but it is fair to say that recent work has focussed particularly on the following areas the notion of a criterion of identity the correct analysis of identity over time and in particular the disagreement between advocates of perdurance and advocates of endurance as analyses of identity over time the notion of identity across possible worlds and the question of its relevance to the correct analysis of de re modal discourse the notion of contingent identity the question of whether the identity relation is or is similar to the composition relation and the notion of vague identity A radical position advocated by Peter Geach is that these debates as usually conducted are void for lack of a subject matter the notion of absolute identity they presuppose has no application there is only relative identity Another increasingly popular view is the one advocated by Lewis although the debates make sense they cannot genuinely be debates about identity since there are no philosophical problems about identity Identity is an utterly unproblematic notion What there are are genuine problems which can be stated using the language of identity But since these can be restated without the language of identity they are not problems about identity For example it is a puzzle an aspect of the so called problem of personal identity whether the same person can have different bodies at different times But this is just the puzzle whether a person can have different bodies at different times So since it can be stated without the language of personal identity it is not a problem about identity but about personhood This article provides an overview of the topics indicated above some assessment of the debates and suggestions for further reading To say that things are identical is to say that they are the same Identity and sameness mean the same their meanings are identical However they have more than one meaning A distinction is customarily drawn between qualitative and numerical identity or sameness Things with qualitative identity share properties so things can be more or less qualitatively identical Poodles and Great Danes are qualitatively identical because they share the property of being a dog and such properties as go along with that but two poodles will very likely have greater qualitative identity Numerical identity requires absolute or total qualitative identity and can only hold between a thing and itself Its name implies the controversial view that it is the only identity relation in accordance with which we can properly count or number things and are to be properly counted as one just in case they are numerically identical Geach Numerical identity is our topic As noted it is at the centre of several philosophical debates but to many seems in itself wholly unproblematic for it is just that relation everything has to itself and nothing else and what could be less problematic than that Moreover if the notion is problematic it is difficult to see how the problems could be resolved since it is difficult to see how a thinker could have the conceptual resources with which to explain the concept of identity whilst lacking that concept itself The basicness of the notion of identity in our conceptual scheme and in particular the link between identity and quantification has been particularly noted by Quine Numerical identity can be characterised as just done as the relation everything has to itself and to nothing else But this is circular since nothing else just means no numerically non identical thing It can be defined equally circularly because quantifying over all equivalence relations including itself as the smallest equivalence relation an equivalence relation being one which is reflexive symmetric and transitive for example having the same shape Other circular definitions are available Usually it is defined as the equivalence relation or the reflexive relation satisfying Leibniz Law the principle of the indiscernibility of identicals that if is identical with then everything true of is true of Intuitively this is right but only picks out identity uniquely if what is true of is understood to include being identical with otherwise it is too weak Circularity is thus not avoided Nevertheless Leibniz Law appears to be crucial to our understanding of identity and more particularly to our understanding of distinctness we exhibit our commitment to it whenever we infer from Fa and Not Fb that a is not identical with Strictly what is being employed in such inferences is the contrapositive of Leibniz Law if something true of a is false of a is not identical with which some in the context of the discussion of vague identity have questioned but it appears as indispensable to our grip on the concept of identity as Leibniz Law itself The converse of Leibniz Law the principle of the identity of indiscernibles that if everything true of is true of is identical with is correspondingly trivial if what is true of is understood to include being identical with as required if Leibniz Law is to characterise identity uniquely among equivalence relations But often it is read with what is true of restricted to qualitative non relational properties of It then becomes philosophically controversial Thus it is debated whether a symmetrical universe is possible a universe containing two qualitatively indistinguishable spheres and nothing else Black Leibniz Law has itself been subject to controversy in the sense that the correct explanation of apparent counter examples has been debated Leibniz Law must be clearly distinguished from the substitutivity principle that if a and are codesignators if a is a true sentence of English they are everywhere substitutable salva veritate This principle is trivially false Hesperus contains eight letters Phosphorus contains ten but Hesperus the Evening Star is Phosphorus the Morning Star Again despite the identity it is informative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus but not to be told that Hesperus is Hesperus On Sense and Reference in Frege Giorgione was so called because of his size Barbarelli was not but Giorgione was Barbarelli Quine Reference and Modality in It is a necessary truth that is greater than it is not a necessary truth that the number of planets is greater than although is the number of planets The explanation of the failure of the substitutivity principle can differ from case to case In the first example it is plausible to say that Hesperus contains eight letters is not about Hesperus but about the name and the same is true mutatis mutandis of Phosphorus contains ten letters Thus the names do not have the same referents in the identity statement and the predications In the Giorgione Barbarelli example this seems less plausible Here the correct explanation is plausibly that is so called because of his size expresses different properties depending on the name it is attached to and so expresses the property of being called Barbarelli because of his size when attached to Barbarelli and being called Giorgione because of his size when attached to Giorgione It is more controversial how to explain the Hesperus Phosphorus and the number of planets examples Frege own explanation of the former was to assimilate it to the Hesperus Phosphorus case in It is informative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus the names do not stand for their customary referent but for their senses A Fregean explanation of the number of planets example may also be offered it is necessary that creates a context in which numerical designators stand for senses rather than numbers For present purposes the important point to recognise is that however these counter examples to the substitutivity principle are explained they are not counter examples to Leibniz Law which says nothing about substitutivity of codesignators in any language The view of identity just put forward henceforth the classical view characterises it as the equivalence relation which everything has to itself and to nothing else and which satisfies Leibniz Law These formal properties ensure that within any theory expressible by means of a fixed stock of one or many place predicates quantifiers and truth functional connectives any two predicates which can be regarded as expressing identity any predicates satisfying the two schemata for all Rxx and for all for all Rxy Fx Fy for any one place predicate in place of will be extensionally equivalent They do not however ensure that any two place predicate does express identity within a particular theory for it may simply be that the descriptive resources of the theory are insufficiently rich to distinguish items between which the equivalence relation expressed by the predicate holds Identity in Geach Following Geach call a two place predicate with these properties in a theory an I predicate in that theory Relative to another richer theory the same predicate interpreted in the same way may not be an I predicate If so it will not and did not even in the poorer theory express identity For example having the same income as will be an I predicate in a theory in which persons with the same income are indistinguishable but not in a richer theory Quine Identity Ostension and Hypostasis in his has suggested that when a predicate is an I predicate in a theory only because the language in which the theory is expressed does not allow one to distinguish items between which it holds one can reinterpret the sentences of the theory so that the I predicate in the newly interpreted theory does express identity Every sentence will have just the same truth conditions under the new interpretation and the old but the references of its subsentential parts will be different Thus Quine suggests if one has a language in which one speaks of persons and in which persons of the same income are indistinguishable the predicates of the language may be reinterpreted so that the predicate which previously expressed having the same income comes now to express identity The universe of discourse now consists of income groups not people The extensions of the monadic predicates are classes of income groups and in general the extension of an place predicate is a class of member sequences of income groups Quine Any two place predicate expressing an equivalence relation could be an I predicate relative to some sufficiently impoverished theory and Quine suggestion will be applicable to any such predicate if it is applicable at all But it remains that it is not guaranteed that a two place predicate that is an I predicate in the theory to which it belongs expresses identity In fact no condition can be stated in a first order language for a predicate to express identity rather than mere indiscernibility by the resources of the language However in a second order language in which quantification over all properties not just those for which the language contains predicates is possible and Leibniz Law is therefore statable identity can be uniquely characterised Identity is thus not first order but only second order definable This situation provides the basis for Geach radical contention that the notion of absolute identity has no application and that there is only relative identity This section contains a brief discussion of Geach complex view For more details see the entry on relative identity Deutsch Dummett and Hawthorne and Noonan Geach maintains that since no criterion can be given by which a predicate expressing an I predicate may be determined to express not merely indiscernibility relative to the language to which it belongs but also absolute indiscernibility we should jettison the classical notion of identity He dismisses the possibility of defining identity in a second order language on the ground of the paradoxical nature of unrestricted quantification over properties and aims his fire particularly at Quine proposal that an I predicate in a first order theory may always be interpreted as expressing absolute identity even if such an interpretation is not required Geach objects that Quine suggestion leads to a Baroque Meinongian ontology and is inconsistent with Quine own expressed preference for desert landscapes Identity in Geach We may usefully state Geach thesis using the terminology of absolute and relative equivalence relations Let us say that an equivalence relation is absolute if and only if if stands in it to there cannot be some other equivalence relation holding between anything and either or but not holding between and If an equivalence relation is not absolute it is relative Classical identity is an absolute equivalence relation Geach main contention is that any expression for an absolute equivalence relation in any possible language will have the null class as its extension and so there can be no expression for classical identity in any possible language This is the thesis he argues against Quine Geach also maintains the sortal relativity of identity statements that is the same A as does not split up into is an A and is an A and More precisely stated what Geach denies is that whenever a term A is interpretable as a sortal term in a language a term which makes independent sense following the same the expression interpretable as is the same A as in language will be satisfied by a pair only if the I predicate of is satisfied by Geach thesis of the sortal relativity of identity thus neither entails nor is entailed by his thesis of the inexpressibility of identity It is the sortal relativity thesis that is the central issue between Geach and Wiggins and It entails that a relation expressible in the form is the same A as in a language where A is a sortal term in need not entail indiscernibility even by the resources of Geach argument against Quine exists in two versions an earlier and a later In its earlier version the argument is merely that following Quine suggestion to interpret a language in which some expression is an I predicate so that the I predicate expresses classical identity sins against a highly intuitive methodological programme enunciated by Quine himself namely that as our knowledge expands we should unhesitatingly expand our ideology our stock of predicables but should be much more wary about altering our ontology the interpretation of our bound name variables Geach argument is that in view of the mere possibility of carving out of a language in which the relational expressions are not I predicates sub languages in which these expressions are I predicates if Quine suggested proposal of reinterpretation is possible for each Ln the user of will be committed to any number of entities not quantified over in namely for each Ln those entities for which the I predicate of Ln En gives a criterion of absolute identity This will be so because any sentence of will retain its truth conditions in any Ln to which it belongs reinterpreted as Quine proposes but of course it is flatly inconsistent to say that as a member of a large theory a sentence retains its truth conditions but not its ontological commitment The crucial premiss of this argument is thus that sameness of truth conditions entails sameness of ontological commitment But this is not true The ontological commitments of a theory according to Quine whose notion this is are those entities that must lie within the domain of quantification of the theory if the theory is to be true or the entities the predicates of the theory have to be true of if the theory is to be true A theory is not ontologically committed we may say to whatever has to be in the universe for it to be true but only to whatever has to be in its universe for it to be true Thus there is no argument from sameness of truth conditions to sameness of ontological commitments The later version of Geach argument needs a different response The difference between the earlier version and the later one is that in the later to be found in Geach Geach claim is not merely that Quine thesis about possible reinterpretation has a consequence which is unpalatable but that it leads to an out and out logical absurdity the existence of what he calls absolute surmen entities for which having the same surname constitutes a criterion of absolute identity ie entails indiscernibility in all respects Because Geach is now making this stronger claim the objection that his argument depends upon the incorrect assumption that sameness of truth conditions entails sameness of ontological commitment is no longer relevant In order to make out his case Geach has to establish just two points First that there are sentences of English supplemented by the predicate is the same surman as explained to mean is a man and has the same surname as which are evidently true and which considered as sentences of that fragment of English in which is the same surman as is an I predicate when this is interpreted in the way Quine suggests can be true only if absolute surmen exist And secondly that the existence of absolute surmen is absurd But in the end Geach fails to establish these two points Quine would say that for the fragment of English in question the domain of the variables can be considered to consist of classes of men with the same surname and the predicates interpreted as holding of such classes Thus the predicate is the same surman as will no longer be true of pairs of men if we adopt Quine suggestion I am writing remember in English not in the fragment of English under discussion but rather of pairs of classes of men with the same surname these then will be Geach absolute surmen Now Geach attempts to rule this out by the argument that whatever is a surman is by definition a man But this argument fails The predicate is a man will also be in the language fragment in which is the same surman as is the I predicate and so it too will be reinterpreted if we follow Quine suggestion as holding of classes of men with the same surname Thus the sentence Whatever is a surman is a man will be true in the language fragment interpreted in Quine way just as it is in English as a whole What will not be true however is that whatever the predicate is a surman is true of as it occurs in the language fragment reinterpreted in Quine way is a thing of which is a man as it occurs in English as a whole is true of But Geach has no right to demand that this should be the case Even so this demand can be met For the domain of the interpretation of the language fragment in which is the same surman as is the I predicate can in fact be taken to consist of men namely to be a class containing exactly one representative man for each class of men with the same surname Thus as Geach says absolute surmen will be just some among men Geach goes on there will for example be just one surman with the surname Jones but if this is an absolute surman and he is a certain man then which of the Jones boys is he But this question which is of course only answerable using predicates which belong to the part of English not included in the language fragment in which is the same surman as is the I predicate is not an impossible one to answer It is merely that the answer will depend upon the particular interpretation that the language fragment has in fact been given Geach is therefore not entitled to go on Surely we have run into an absurdity It thus seems that his argument for the non existence of absolute identity fails Geach argument for his second thesis that of the sortal relativity of identity is that it provides the best solution to a variety of well known puzzles about identity and counting at a time and over time The most well known puzzle is that of the cat on the mat which comes in two versions The first version goes like this Wiggins contains the first appearance of this version in present day philosophical literature an equivalent puzzle is that of Dion and Theon see Burke Suppose a cat Tibbles is sitting on a mat Now consider that portion of Tibbles that includes everything except its tail its tail complement and call it Tib Tib is smaller than Tibbles so they are not identical But what if we now amputate the cat tail A time reversed or growing version can be considered in which a tail is grafted on to a tailless cat the same responses considered below will be available but may differ in relative plausibility Tibbles and Tib will now coincide If Tibbles is still a cat it is hard to see by what criterion one could deny that Tib is a cat Yet they are distinct individuals since they have different histories But there is just one cat on the mat So they cannot be distinct cats They must be the same cat even though they are distinct individuals and so identity under the sortal concept cat must be a relative identity relation The second version presented in Geach compare Unger goes as follows Tibbles is sitting on the mat and is the only cat sitting on the mat But Tibbles has at least hairs Geach continues Now let be the largest continuous mass of feline tissue on the mat Then for any of our hairs say hn there is a proper part cn of which contains precisely all of except that hair hn and every such part cn differs in a describable way both from any other such part say cm and from as a whole Moreover fuzzy as the concept cat may be it is clear that not only is a cat but also any part cn is a cat cn would clearly be a cat were the hair hn to be plucked out and we cannot reasonably suppose that plucking out a hair generates a cat so cn must already have been a cat The conclusion of course is the same as in the previous version of the argument there is only one cat on the mat so all the distinct entities that qualify as cats must be the same cat This version of the argument can be resisted by insisting that the concept of a cat is maximal no proper part of a cat is a cat The first version may be resisted in a variety of ways Some deny the existence of the tail complement at all van Inwagen Olson others deny that the tail complement survives the amputation Burke Another possibility is to say that certain of the historical and or modal predicates possessed by Tibbles and not Tib are essential to being a cat so that Tib is not predicatively a cat Wiggins Again it can be accepted that both Tib and Tibbles are cats but deny that in counting them as one we are counting by identity even cat identity rather we are counting by almost identity Lewis Another possibility is to accept that both Tib and Tibbles are cats but deny that they are distinct rather Tib and Tibbles are two names of the same cat stage Hawley Sider There is then no very compelling argument for Geach sortal relativity thesis to be based on such examples given the variety of responses available some of which will be returned to below On the other hand no alternative solution to the puzzle of the cat on the mat stands out as clearly superior to the rest or clearly superior to the sortal relativity thesis as a solution We should conclude that this component of Geach position though not proven is not refuted either and possibly that the linguistic data provide no basis for a decision for or against Criteria of identity A notion that Geach deploys extensively and which is also in common use by his opponents is that of a criterion of identity a standard by which identity is to be judged This section will attempt to untangle some of the complexities this notion involves The notion of a criterion of identity was introduced into philosophical terminology by Frege and strongly emphasised by Wittgenstein Exactly how it is to be interpreted and the extent of its applicability are still matters of debate A considerable obstacle to understanding contemporary philosophical usage of the term however is that the notion does not seem to be a unitary one In the case of abstract objects the case discussed by Frege the criterion of identity for Fs is thought of as an equivalence relation holding between objects distinct from Fs Thus the criterion of identity for directions is parallelism of lines that is the direction of line a is identical with the direction of line if and only if line a is parallel to line The criterion of identity for numbers is equinumerosity of concepts that is the number of Fs is identical with the number of Gs if and only if there are exactly as many Fs as Gs The relation between the criterion of identity for Fs and the criterion of application for the concept the standard for the application of the concept to an individual is then that to be an is just to be something for which questions of identity and distinctness are to settled by appeal to the criterion of identity for Fs Thus when Frege went on to give an explicit definition of numbers as extensions of concepts he appealed to it only to deduce what has come to be called Hume principle his statement of his criterion of identity for numbers in terms of equinumerosity of concepts and emphasised that he regarded the appeal to extensions as inessential In the case of concrete objects however things seem to stand differently Often the criterion of identity for a concrete object of type is said to be a relation such that for any Fs and if and only if Rxy In this case the criterion of identity for Fs is not stated as a relation between entities distinct from Fs and the criterion of identity cannot plausibly be thought of as determining the criterion of application Another example of the lack of uniformity in the case of the notion of a criterion of idenity in contemporary philosophy is in the case of concrete objects a distinction customarily made between a criterion of diachronic identity and a criterion of synchronic identity the former taking the form is at the same as is at if and only if where what fills the gap is some statement of a relation holding between objects and and times and In the case of persons for example a candidate criterion of diachronic identity is is at the same person as is at if and only if at is psychologically continuous with at A criterion of synchronic identity by contrast will typically specify how the parts of an thing existing at a time must be related or how one at a time is marked off from another One way of bringing system into the discussion of criteria of identity is to make use of the distinction between one level and two level criteria of identity Williamson The Fregean criteria of identity for directions and numbers are two level The objects for which the criterion is given are distinct from and can be pictured as at a higher level than the objects between which the relation specified holds On the other hand the criterion of identity for sets given by the Axiom of Extensionality sets are the same if they have the same members and Davidson criterion of event identity events are the same if they have the same causes and effects The Individuation of Events in his are one level the objects for which the criterion of identity is stated are the same as those between which the criterial relation obtains Not all criteria of identity can be two level on pain of infinite regress and it is tempting to think that the distinction between objects for which a two level criterion is appropriate and those for which a one level criterion is appropriate coincides with that between abstract and concrete objects However a more general application of the two level notion is possible In fact it can be applied to any type of object such that the criterion of identity for Ks can be thought of as an equivalence relation between a distinct type of object but some such objects may intuitively be regarded as concrete How general this makes its application is a matter of controversy In particular if persisting things are thought of as composed of instantaneous temporal parts see discussion below the problem of supplying a diachronic criterion of identity for concrete objects can be regarded as the problem of providing a two level criterion But if persisting things are not thought of in this way then not all persisting things can be provided with two level criteria Though some can For example it is quite plausible that the criterion of identity over time for persons should be thought of as given by a relation between bodies Any two level criterion can be restated in a one level form though of course not conversely For example to say that the direction of line a is identical with the direction of line if and only if line a is parallel to line is to say that directions are the same if and only if the lines they are of are parallel which is the form of a one level criterion A way of unifying the various different ways of talking of criteria of identity is thus to take as the paradigmatic form of a statement of a criterion of identity a statement of the form for any for any if is an and is an then if and only if Rxy Lowe If the notion is interpreted in this way then the relation between the criterion of identity and the criterion of application will be that of one way determination The criterion of identity will be determined by but not determine the criterion of application For in general a one level criterion of identity for Fs will be equivalent to a conjunction of a statement of necessary and a statement of sufficient conditions A statement of necessary conditions will take the form for any for any if is an and is an then only if Rxy which is equivalent to for any if is an then Rxx But of course says nothing about identity rather it simply specifies a necessary condition of being an So therefore does Once the criterion of application for the concept of an is specified the necessary and sufficient conditions for its application there is no need for any further specification of identity in a statement of form What of sufficient conditions of identity A specification of a sufficient condition corresponding to a one level criterion of identity would presumably have to take the form for any for any if is an and is an then if Rxy This is equivalent to for any and if Rxy and it is not the case that then is not an or is not an which denies the existence of distinct related Fs cannot be represented as specifying either a necessary or a sufficient condition of Fness in identity free terms But what does do is to specify a necessary condition on a concept being the concept of an In this respect it is like the proposition there is at most one divine being there are no distinct coexistent divine beings which specifies a condition any concept has to satisfy to be that of a divine being However a specification of the necessary and sufficient conditions of divinity together with the facts will determine the truth value of there is at most one divine being The same is true mutatis mutandis of the concept of an and assertions of form Once the necessary and sufficient conditions of being an have been laid down no further stipulation is required to determine which assertions of form are true In short specifying the necessary and sufficient conditions of being an leaves no more room for further specification of the sufficient conditions of identity than it does for further specification of necessary conditions of identity This conclusion is of course in agreement with Lewis view that there are no genuine problems about identity as such Lewis Ch but it is in tension with the thought that sortal concepts as distinct from adjectival concepts are to be characterised by their involvement of criteria of identity as well as criteria of application A conception of identity criteria which allows this characterisation of the notion of a sortal concept and which has so far not been mentioned is that of Dummett Dummett denies that a criterion of identity must always be regarded as a criterion of identity for a type of object There is a basic level he suggests at which what a criterion of identity is a criterion of is the truth of a statement in which no objects are referred to Such a statement can be expressed using demonstratives and pointing gestures for instance by saying This is the same cat as that pointing first to a head and then a tail In such a statement which he calls a statement of identification in Dummett view there need be no reference to objects made by the use of the demonstratives any more than reference is made to any object in a feature placing sentence like It hot here A statement of identification is merely as it were a feature placing relational statement like This is darker than that A grasp of a sortal concept involves both grasp of the truth conditions of such statements of identification involving and also grasp of the truth conditions of what Dummett calls crude predications involving statements of the form this is in which the demonstrative again does not serve to refer to any object Adjectival terms which have only a criterion of application and no criterion of identity are ones which have a use in such crude predications but no use in statements of identification Sortal terms as just noted have a use in both contexts and sortal terms may share their criteria of application but differ in their criteria of identity since grasp of the truth conditions of the crude predication This is does not determine grasp of the truth conditions of the statement of identification This is the same as that thus I can know when it is right to say This is a book without knowing when it is right to say This is the same book as that On Dummett account then it may be possible to accept that whenever a criterion of identity for a type of object is to be given it must be expressible as a two level criterion Essentially one level criteria one level criteria not expressible in a two level form are redundant replaceable by what we might call Dummettian zero level criteria Criteria of identity can be employed synchronically as in the examples just given to determine whether two coexistent objects are parts of the same object of a kind or diachronically to determine identity over time Identity over time is a controversial notion however because time involves change Heraclitus argued that one could not bathe in the same river twice because new waters were ever flowing in Hume argued that identity over time was a fiction we substitute for a collection of related objects Such views can be seen as based on a misunderstanding of Leibniz Law if a thing changes something is true of it at the later time that is not true of it at the earlier so it is not the same The answer is that what is true of it at the later time is say being muddy at the later time which was always true of it similarly what is true of it at the earlier time suitably expressed remains true of it But the question remains how to characterise identity through time and across change given that there is such a thing One topic which has always loomed large in this debate has been the issue in the terminology of Lewis Ch of perdurance versus endurance Others for which there is no space for discussion here include the debate over Ship of Theseus and reduplication or fission problems and associated issues about best candidate or no rival candidate accounts of identity over time and the debate over Humean supervenience see articles on relative identity personal identity Hawley and Sider According to one view material objects persist by having temporal parts or stages which exist at different times and are to be distinguished by the times at which they exist this is known as the view that material objects perdure Other philosophers deny that this is so according to them when a material object exists at different times it is wholly present at those times for it has no temporal parts but only spatial parts which likewise are wholly present at the different times they exist This is known as the view that material objects endure Perdurance theorists as Quine puts it reject the point of view inherent in the tenses of our natural language From that point of view persisting things endure and change through time but do not extend through time but only through space Thus persisting things are to be sharply distinguished from events or processes which precisely do extend through time One way of describing the position of the perdurance theorist then is to say that he denies the existence of a distinct ontological category of persisting things or substances Thus Quine writes physical objects conceived thus four dimensionally in space time are not to be distinguished from events or in the concrete sense of the term processes Each comprises simply the content however heterogeneous of some portion of space time however disconnected or gerrymandered In recent controversy two arguments have been at the centre of the endurance perdurance debate one employed by perdurance theorists and the other by endurance theorists for other arguments and issues see the separate article on temporal parts Hawley and Sider An argument for perdurance which has been hotly debated is due to David Lewis If perdurance is rejected the ascription of dated or tensed properties to objects must be regarded as assertions of irreducible relations between objects and times If Tabby is fat on Monday that is a relation between Tabby and Monday and if perdurance is rejected it is an irreducible relation between Tabby and Monday According to perdurance theory however while it is still of course a relation between Tabby and Monday it is not irrreducible it holds between Tabby and Monday because the temporal part of Tabby on Monday Tabby on Monday is intrinsically fat If perdurance is rejected however no such intrinsic possessor of the property of fatness can be recognised Tabby fatness on Monday must be regarded as an irreducible state of affairs According to Lewis this consequence of the rejection of the perdurance theory is incredible Whether he is right about this is the subject of intense debate Haslanger Even if Lewis is right however the perdurance theory may still be found wanting since it does not secure the most commonsensical position that fatness is a property of a cat Haslanger According to perdurance theory rather it is a property of a temporal cat part Those known as stage theorists Hawley Sider accepting the ontology of perdurance theory but modifying its semantics offer a way to secure this desirable result Every temporal part of a cat is a cat they say so Tabby on Monday which is what we refer to by Tabby on Monday is a cat and is fat just as we would like Stage theorists have to pay a price for this advantage over perdurance theory however For they must accept either that our reports of the cross temporal number of cats are not always reports of the counting of cats as when I say truly that I have only ever owned three cats or that two cat stages cats may be counted as one and the same cat so that counting cats is not always counting in accordance with absolute identity An argument against the perdurance theory that has been the focus of interest is one presented in various guises by a number of writers including Wiggins Thomson and van Inwagen Applied to persons it can equally well be applied to other persisting things it asserts that persons have different properties in particular different modal properties from the summations of person stages with which the perdurance theory identifies them Thus by Leibniz Law this identification must be mistaken As David Wiggins states the argument Anything that is part of a Lesniewskian sum a mereological whole defined by its parts is necessarily part of it But no person or normal material object is necessarily in the total state that will correspond to the person or object moment postulated by the theory under discussion To elaborate a little I might have died when I was five years old But that maximal summation of person stages which according to perdurance theory is me and has a temporal extent of at least fifty years could not have had a temporal extent of a mere five years So I cannot be such a summation of stages This argument illustrates the interdependence of the various topics discussed under the rubric of identity Whether it is valid of course depends on the correct analysis of modal predication and in particular on whether it should be analysed in terms of identity across possible worlds or in terms of Lewisean counterpart theory This is the topic to which we next turn In the interpretation of modal discourse recourse is often made to the idea of identity across possible worlds If modal discourse is interpreted in this way it becomes natural to regard a statement ascribing a modal property to an individual as asserting the identity of that individual across worlds John might have been a millionaire on this view asserts that there is a possible world in which an individual identical with John is a millionaire John could not have been a millionaire asserts that in any world in which an individual identical with John exists that individual is not a millionaire However though this is perhaps the most natural way to interpret de re modal statements once it has been accepted that the apparatus of possible worlds is to be used as an interpretative tool there are well known difficulties that make the approach problematic For example it seems reasonable to suppose that a complex artefact like a bicycle could have been made of different parts On the other hand it does not seem right that the same bicycle could have been constructed out of completely different parts But now consider a series of possible worlds beginning with the actual world each containing a bicycle just slightly different from the one in the previous world the last world in the sequence being one in which there is a bicycle composed of completely different parts from the one in the actual world One cannot say that each bicycle is identical with the one in the neighbouring world but not identical with the corresponding bicycle in distant worlds since identity is transitive Hence it seems one must either adopt an extreme mereological essentialism according to which no difference of parts is possible for an individual or reject the interpretation of de re modal discourse as asserting identity across possible worlds This and other problems with cross world identity suggest that some other weaker relation of similarity or what David Lewis calls counterparthood should be employed in a possible world analysis of modal discourse Since similarity is not transitive this allows us to say that the bicycle might have had some different parts without having to say that it might have been wholly different On the other hand such a substitution does not seem unproblematic for a claim about what I might have done hardly seems at first sight to be correctly interpretable as a claim about what someone else however similar to me does in another possible world Kripke note An assessment of the counterpart theoretic analysis is vital not just to understanding modal discourse however but also to getting to the correct account of identity over time For as we have just seen the argument against perdurance theory outlined at the end of the last section depends on the correct interpretation of modal discourse In fact it is invalid on a counterpart theoretic analysis which allows different counterpart relations different similarity relations to be invoked according to the sense of the singular term which is the subject of the de re modal predication Lewis Ch since the counterpart relation relevant to the assessment of a de re modal predication with a singular term whose sense determines that it refers to a person will be different from that relevant to the assessment of a de re modal predication with a singular term whose sense determines that it refers to a sum of person stages I might have existed for only five years means on the Lewisean account There is a person in some possible world similar to me in those respects important to personhood who exists for only five years The maximal summation of person stages of which this current stage is a stage might have existed for only five years means There is a summation of person stages similar to this one in those respects important to the status of an entity as a summation of stages which exists for only five years Since the two similarity relations in question are distinct the first modal statement may be true and the second false even if I am identical with the sum of stages in question Counterpart theory is also significant to the topic of identity over time in another way since it provides the analogy to which the stage theorist who regards all everyday reference as reference to momentary stages rather than to perdurers appeals to explain de re temporal predication Thus according to the stage theorist just as I might have been fat does not require the existence of a possible world in which an object identical with me is fat but only the existence of a world in which a modal counterpart of me is fat so I used to be fat does not require the existence of a past time at which someone identical with the present momentary stage which is me was fat but only the existence of a past time at which a temporal counterpart of me was fat The problem of identity over time for things of a kind for stage theorists is just the problem of characterizing the appropriate temporal counterpart relation for things of that kind For a more detailed discussion of the topic see the entry transworld identity Whether de re modal discourse is to be interpreted in terms of identity across possible worlds or counterpart theoretically or in some other way entirely is also relevant to our next topic that of contingent identity Before Kripke writings it seemed a platitude that statements of identity could be contingent when they contained two terms differing in sense but identical in reference and so were not analytic Kripke challenged this platitude though of course he did not reject the possibility of contingent statements of identity But he argued that when the terms flanking the sign of identity were what he called rigid designators an identity statement if true at all had to be necessarily true but need not be knowable a priori as an analytic truth would be Connectedly Kripke argued that identity and distinctness were themselves necessary relations if an object is identical with itself it is necessarily so and if it is distinct from another it is necessarily so Kripke arguments were very persuasive but there are examples that suggest that his conclusion is too sweeping that even identity statements containing rigid designators can be in a sense contingent The debate over contingent identity is concerned with the assessment and proper analysis of these examples One of the earliest examples is provided by Gibbard Consider a statue Goliath and the clay Lumpl from which it is composed Imagine that Lumpl and Goliath coincide in their spatiotemporal extent It is tempting to conclude that they are identical But they might not have been Goliath might have been rolled into a ball and destroyed Lumpl would have continued to exist The two would have been distinct Thus it seems that the identity of Lumpl and Goliath if admitted must be acknowledged as merely contingent One reaction to this argument available to the convinced Kripkean is simply to deny that Lumpl and Goliath are identical But to accept this is to accept that purely material entities like statues and lumps of clay of admittedly identical material constitution at all times may nonetheless be distinct though distinguished only by modal dispositional or counterfactual properties To many however this seems highly implausible which provides the strength of the argument for contingent identity David Lewis in Counterparts of Persons and their Bodies in his suggests that the identity of a person with his body assuming the person and the body like Goliath and Lumpl are at all times coincident is contingent since bodily interchange is a possibility He appeals to counterpart theory modified to allow a variety of counterpart relations to explain this Contingent identity then makes sense since I and my body might not have been identical now translates into counterpart theory as There is a possible world a unique personal counterpart in of me and a unique bodily counterpart in of my body such that and are not identical What is crucial to making sense of contingent identity is an acceptance that modal predicates are inconstant in denotation that is stand for different properties when attached to different singular terms or different quantifying expressions Counterpart theory provides one way of explaining this inconstancy but is not necessarily the only way Gibbard Noonan However whether the examples of contingent identity in the literature are persuasive enough to make it reasonable to accept the certainly initially surprising idea that modal predications are inconstant in denotation is still a matter of considerable controversy Finally in this section it is worth noting explicitly the interdependence of the topics under discussion only if the possibility of contingent identity is secured by counterpart theory or some other account of de re modality which does not straightforwardly analyse de re modal predication in terms of identity across possible worlds can perdurance theory or stage theory as an account of identity across time be sustained against the modal arguments of Wiggins Thomson and van Inwagen A thesis that has a long pedigree but has only recently been gathering attention in the contemporary literature is the Composition as Identity thesis The thesis comes in a weak and a strong form In its weak form the thesis is that the mereological composition relation is analogous in a number of important ways to the identity relation and so deserves to be called a kind of identity In its strong form the thesis is that the composition relation is strictly identical with the identity relation viz that the parts of a whole are literally collectively identical with the whole itself The strong thesis was considered by Plato in Parmenides and versions of the thesis have been discussed by many historical figures since Harte Normore and Brown The progenitor of the modern version of the thesis is Baxter but it is most often discussed under the formulation of it given by Lewis who first considers the strong thesis before rejecting it in favour of the weak thesis Both the strong and the weak versions of the thesis are motivated by the fact that there is an especially intimate relation between a whole and its parts a whole is nothing over and above its parts buttressed by claims that identity and composition are alike in various ways Lewis makes five likeness claims Ontological Innocence If one believes that some object exists one does not gain a commitment to a further object by believing that something identical with exists Likewise if one believes that some objects xn exist one does not gain a commitment to a further object by claiming that something composed of xn exists Automatic Existence If some object exists then it automatically follows that something identical with exists Likewise if some objects xn exist then it automatically follows that something composed of xn exists Unique Composition If something is identical with then anything identical with is identical with and anything identical with is identical with Likewise if some things yn compose then any things that compose are identical with yn and anything identical with is composed of yn Exhaustive Description If is identical with then an exhaustive description of is an exhaustive description of and vice versa Likewise if yn compose then an exhaustive description of yn is an exhaustive description of and vice versa Same Location If is identical with then necessarily and fill the same region of spacetime Likewise if yn compose then necessarily yn and fill the same region of spacetime Clearly not all will agree with each of Lewis likeness claims Anyone who denies unrestricted mereological composition for example will deny And the defender of strong pluralism in the material constitution debate one who defends the view that there can be all time coincident entities will deny And some endurantists who think that ordinary material objects can have distinct parts at distinct times will deny But there is a more general problem with as van Inwagen has made clear Consider a world that contains just two simples and Now consider the difference between someone who believes that and compose something and someone who does not Ask how many objects do and believe there to be in The answer it seems is that believes that there are three things and only two So how can a commitment to the existence of fusions be ontologically innocent One recent suggestion is that although a commitment to the existence of fusions is not ontologically innocent it almost is to commit oneself to fusions is to commit oneself to further entities but because they are not fundamental entities they are not ones that matter for the purpose of theory choice Cameron Schaffer Williams and see also Hawley If one believes Lewis likeness claims one will be tempted by at least the weak Composition as Identity thesis If composition is a type of identity this gives some kind of explanation of why the parallels between the two hold But the strong thesis that the composition relation is the identity relation gives a fuller explanation So why not hold the strong thesis Because many think there are additional challenges that face anyone who wishes to defend the strong thesis The classical identity relation is one that can only have single objects as relata as in George Orwell Eric Blair If we adopt a language that allows the formation of plural terms we can unproblematically define a plural identity relation that holds between pluralities of objects too Plural identity statements such as the hunters are identical with the gatherers are understood to mean that for all is one of the hunters iff is one of the gatherers But according to the strong Composition as Identity thesis there can also be true hybrid identity statements that relate pluralities and single objects That is sentences such as the bricks the wall are taken by the defender of strong Composition as Identity to be well formed sentences that express strict identities The first challenge facing the defender of the strong thesis is the least troublesome It is the syntactic problem that hybrid identity statements are ungrammatical in English Van Inwagen Whilst George Orwell is identical with Eric Blair and the hunters are identical with the gatherers are well formed it seems that the bricks are identical with the wall is not However there is in fact some doubt about whether hybrid identity statements are ungrammatical in English and some have pointed out that this is anyway a mere grammatical artefact of English that is not present in other languages Norwegian and Hungarian So it seems that the most this challenge calls for is a mild form of grammatical revisionism And we have at any rate formal languages that allow hybrid constructions to be made in which to express the claims made by the defender of the strong Composition as Identity thesis Sider Cotnoir NB The claims regarding Norwegian and Hungarian are to be found in these two papers The second challenge is more troublesome It is the semantic problem of providing coherent truth conditions for hybrid identity statements The standard way to provide the truth conditions for the classical identity relation is to say that an identity statement of the form a is true iff a and have the same referents But this account clearly does not work for hybrid identity statements for there is no single referent for a plural term Moreover the standard way of giving the truth conditions for plural identity statements mentioned above does not work for hybrid identity statements either To say that is one of the ys is to say that is classically identical with one of the things in the plurality that is identical with or identical with or identical with yn But then the bricks the wall is true only if the wall is classically identical with one of the bricks with or with or with bn which it isn The third challenge is the most troublesome of all In section it was noted that Leibniz Law and its contrapositive appear to be crucial to our understanding of identity and distinctness But it seems that the defender of strong Composition as Identity must deny this After all the bricks are many but the wall is one The onus is thus on the defender of strong Composition as Identity to explain why we should think the are in hybrid identity statements really expresses the relation of identity The second and the third challenges have been thought by many to be insurmountable Lewis for example rejects strong Composition as Identity on the basis of them But in recent semantic work in this area accounts have emerged that promise to answer both challenges Wallace Cotnoir Whether they do so however remains to be seen Vague identity Like the impossibility of contingent identity the impossibility of vague identity appears to be a straightforward consequence of the classical concept of identity Evans see also Salmon For if a is only vaguely identical with something is true of it that it is only vaguely identical with that is not true of so by Leibniz Law it is not identical with at all Of course there are vague statements of identity Princeton is Princeton Borough Lewis but the conclusion appears to follow that such vagueness is only possible when one or both of the terms flanking the sign of identity is an imprecise designator Relatedly it appears to follow that identity itself must be a determinate relation But some examples suggest that this conclusion is too sweeping that even identity statements containing precise designators may be in some sense indeterminate Consider Everest and some precisely defined hunk of rock ice and snow Rock of which it is indeterminate whether its boundaries coincide with those of Everest It is tempting to think that Everest and Rock are both precise designators if Everest is not is anything Tye and that Everest is Rock is nonetheless in some sense indeterminate Those who take this view have to respond to Evans original argument about which there has been intense debate see separate article on vagueness Edgington Lewis Parsons van Inwagen Williamson and but also to more recent variants There is no space to go into these matters here but one particular variant of the Evans argument worth briefly noting is given by Hawley Alpha and Omega are two people the first of whom steps into van Inwagen fiendish cabinet which disrupts whatever features are relevant to personal identity and the second of whom then steps out It is indeterminate whether Alpha steps out of the cabinet Alpha is such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out of the cabinet It is not indeterminate whether Omega steps out of the cabinet Omega is not such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out of the cabinet Alpha is not identical to Omega This argument differs from the standard version of Evans argument by not depending upon identity involving properties being such that it is indeterminate whether she is Omega to establish distinctness and this removes some sources of controversy Others of course remain The debate over vague identity is too vast to survey here but to finish we can relate this debate to the previously discussed debate about identity over time For some putative cases of vagueness in synchronic identity it seems reasonable to accept the conclusion of Evans argument and locate the indeterminacy in language see the Reply by Shoemaker in Shoemaker and Swinburne for the following example A structure consists of two halls Alpha Hall and Beta Hall linked by a flimsy walkway Smith is located in Alpha Hall Jones in Beta Hall The nature of the structure is such that the identity statement The building in which Smith is located is the building in which Jones is located is neither true nor false because it is indeterminate whether Alpha Hall and Beta Hall count as two distinct buildings or merely as two parts of one and the same building Here it is absolutely clear what is going on The term building is vague in a way that makes it indeterminate whether it applies to the whole structure or just to the two halls Consequently it is indeterminate what the building in which Smith is located and the building in which Jones is located denote Perdurance theorists who assimilate identity over time to identity over space can accommodate vagueness in identity over time in the same way In Hawley example they can say that there are several entities present one that exists before and after the identity obscuring occurrences in the cabinet one that exists only before and one that exists only after It is indeterminate which of these is a person and so it is indeterminate what the singular terms Alpha and Omega refer to This involves taking on an ontology that is larger than we ordinarily recognise but that is not uncongenial to the perdurance theorist who is happy to regard any however spatiotemporally disconnected region as containing a physical object Quine Academic Tools History of the Correspondence Theory The correspondence theory is often traced back to Aristotle well known definition of truth Metaphysics To say of what is that it is not or of what is not that it is is false while to say of what is that it is and of what is not that it is not is true but virtually identical formulations can be found in Plato Cratylus Sophist It is noteworthy that this definition does not highlight the basic correspondence intuition Although it does allude to a relation saying something of something to reality what is the relation is not made very explicit and there is no specification of what on the part of reality is responsible for the truth of a saying As such the definition offers a muted relatively minimal version of a correspondence theory For this reason it has also been claimed as a precursor of deflationary theories of truth Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the Categories where he talks of underlying things that make statements true and implies that these things pragmata are logically structured situations or facts viz his sitting and his not sitting are said to underlie the statements He is sitting and He is not sitting respectively Most influential is Aristotle claim in De Interpretatione that thoughts are likenessess homoiomata of things Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought likeness to a thing or fact it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind Cf Crivelli Szaif Metaphysical and Semantic Versions In medieval authors we find a division between metaphysical and semantic versions of the correspondence theory The former are indebted to the truth as likeness theme suggested by Aristotle overall views the latter are modeled on Aristotle more austere definition from Metaphysics The metaphysical version presented by Thomas Aquinas is the best known Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus Truth is the equation of thing and intellect which he restates as A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality He tends to use conformitas and adaequatio but also uses correspondentia giving the latter a more generic sense De Veritate A cf Summa Theologiae Aquinas credits the Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli with this definition but there is no such definition in Isaac Correspondence formulations can be traced back to the Academic skeptic Carneades century whom Sextus Empiricus Adversos Mathematicos vii reports as having taught that a presentation is true when it is in accord symphonos with the object presented and false when it is in discord with it Similar accounts can be found in various early commentators on Plato and Aristotle cf K√ºnne chap including some Neoplatonists Proklos In Tim II speaks of truth as the agreement or adjustment epharmoge between knower and the known Philoponus In Cat emphasizes that truth is neither in the things or states of affairs pragmata themselves nor in the statement itself but lies in the agreement between the two He gives the simile of the fitting shoe the fit consisting in a relation between shoe and foot not to be found in either one by itself Note that his emphasis on the relation as opposed to its relata is laudable but potentially misleading because truth its being true is not to be identified with a relation between and but with a general relational property of taking the form xRy Fy Further early correspondence formulations can be found in Avicenna Metaphysica and Averroes Tahafut They were introduced to the scholastics by William of Auxerre who may have been the intended recipient of Aquinas mistaken attribution cf Boehner Wolenski Aquinas balanced formula equation of thing and intellect is intended to leave room for the idea that true can be applied not only to thoughts and judgments but also to things or persons a true friend Aquinas explains that a thought is said to be true because it conforms to reality whereas a thing or person is said to be true because it conforms to a thought a friend is true insofar as and because she conforms to our or God conception of what a friend ought to be Medieval theologians regarded both judgment truth as well as thing person truth as somehow flowing from or grounded in the deepest truth which according to the Bible is God I am the way and the truth and the life John Their attempts to integrate this Biblical passage with more ordinary thinking involving truth gave rise to deep metaphysico theological reflections The notion of thing person truth which thus played a very important role in medieval thinking is disregarded by modern and contemporary analytic philosophers but survives to some extent in existentialist and continental philosophy Medieval authors who prefer a semantic version of the correspondence theory often use a peculiarly truncated formula to render Aristotle definition A mental sentence is true if and only if as it signifies so it is sicut significat ita est This emphasizes the semantic relation of signification while remaining maximally elusive about what the it is that is signified by a true sentence and de emphasizing the correspondence relation putting it into the little words as and so Foreshadowing a favorite approach of the century medieval semanticists like Ockham Summa Logicae II and Buridan Sophismata II give exhaustive lists of different truth conditional clauses for sentences of different grammatical categories They refrain from associating true sentences in general with items from a single ontological category Cf Moody Adams McCord Perler Authors of the modern period generally convey the impression that the correspondence theory of truth is far too obvious to merit much or any discussion Brief statements of some version or other can be found in almost all major writers see Descartes ATII Spinoza Ethics axiom vi Locke Essay Leibniz New Essays Hume Treatise and Kant Berkeley who does not seem to offer any account of truth is a potentially significant exception Due to the influence of Thomism metaphysical versions of the theory are much more popular with the moderns than semantic versions But since the moderns generally subscribe to a representational theory of the mind the theory of ideas they would seem to be ultimately committed to spelling out relations like correspondence or conformity in terms of a psycho semantic representation relation holding between ideas or sentential sequences of ideas Locke mental propositions and appropriate portions of reality thereby effecting a merger between metaphysical and semantic versions of the correspondence theory Object Based and Fact Based Versions It is helpful to distinguish between object based and fact based versions of correspondence theories depending on whether the corresponding portion of reality is said to be an object or a fact cf K√ºnne chap Traditional versions of object based theories assumed that the truth bearing items usually taken to be judgments have subject predicate structure An object based definition of truth might look like this A judgment is true if and only if its predicate corresponds to its object to the object referred to by the subject term of the judgment Note that this actually involves two relations to an object a reference relation holding between the subject term of the judgment and the object the judgment is about its object and ii a correspondence relation holding between the predicate term of the judgment and a property of the object Owing to its reliance on the subject predicate structure of truth bearing items the account suffers from an inherent limitation it does not cover truthbearers that lack subject predicate structure conditionals disjunctions and it is not clear how the account might be extended to cover them The problem is obvious and serious it was nevertheless simply ignored in most writings Object based correspondence was the norm until relatively recently Object based correspondence became the norm through Plato pivotal engagement with the problem of falsehood which was apparently notorious at its time In a number of dialogues Plato comes up against an argument advanced by various Sophists to the effect that false judgment is impossible roughly To judge falsely is to judge what is not But one cannot judge what is not for it is not there to be judged To judge something that is not is to judge nothing hence not to judge at all Therefore false judgment is impossible Cf Euthydemus Cratylus Republic Theaetetus Plato has no good answer to this patent absurdity until the Sophist where he finally confronts the issue at length The key step in his solution is the analysis of truthbearers as structured complexes A simple sentence such as Theaetetus sits though simple as a sentence is still a complex whole consisting of words of different kinds a name onoma and a verb rhema having different functions By weaving together verbs with names the speaker does not just name a number of things but accomplishes something meaningful speech logos expressive of the interweaving of ideas eidon symploken The simple sentence is true when Theaetetus the person named by the name is in the state of sitting ascribed to him through the verb and false when Theaetetus is not in that state but in another one cf see Denyer Szaif Only things that are show up in this account in the case of falsehood the ascribed state still is but it is a state different from the one Theaetetus is in The account is extended from speech to thought and belief via Plato well known thesis that thought is speech that occurs without voice inside the soul in conversation with itself the historical origin of the language of thought hypothesis The account does not take into consideration sentences that contain a name of something that is not Pegasus flies thus bequeathing to posterity a residual problem that would become more notorious than the problem of falsehood Aristotle in De Interpretatione adopts Plato account without much ado indeed the beginning of De Interpretatione reads like a direct continuation of the passages from the Sophist mentioned above He emphasizes that truth and falsehood have to do with combination and separation cf De Int in De Anima he says where the alternative of true and false applies there we always find a sort of combining of objects of thought in a quasi unity Unlike Plato Aristotle feels the need to characterize simple affirmative and negative statements predications separately translating rather more literally than is usual An affirmation is a predication of something toward something a negation is a predication of something away from something De Int This characterization reappears early in the Prior Analytics It thus seems fair to say that the subject predicate analysis of simple declarative sentences the most basic feature of Aristotelian term logic which was to reign supreme for many centuries had its origin in Plato response to a sophistical argument against the possibility of falsehood One may note that Aristotle famous definition of truth see Section actually begins with the definition of falsehood Fact based correspondence theories became prominent only in the century though one can find remarks in Aristotle that fit this approach see Section somewhat surprisingly in light of his repeated emphasis on subject predicate structure wherever truth and falsehood are concerned Fact based theories do not presuppose that the truth bearing items have subject predicate structure indeed they can be stated without any explicit reference to the structure of truth bearing items The approach thus embodies an alternative response to the problem of falsehood a response that may claim to extricate the theory of truth from the limitations imposed on it through the presupposition of subject predicate structure inherited from the response to the problem of falsehood favored by Plato Aristotle and the medieval and modern tradition The now classical formulation of a fact based correspondence theory was foreshadowed by Hume Treatise and Mill Logic It appears in its canonical form early in the century in Moore chap and Russell Thus a belief is true when there is a corresponding fact and is false when there is no corresponding fact cf also his and The self conscious emphasis on facts as the corresponding portions of reality and a more serious concern with problems raised by falsehood distinguishes this version from its foreshadowings Russell and Moore forceful advocacy of truth as correspondence to a fact was at the time an integral part of their defense of metaphysical realism Somewhat ironically their formulations are indebted to their idealist opponents Bradley chaps and Joachim the latter was an early advocate of the competing coherence theory who had set up a correspondence to fact account of truth as the main target of his attack on realism Later Wittgenstein and Russell developed logical atomism which introduces an important modification of the fact based correspondence approach see below Section Further modifications of the correspondence theory bringing a return to more overtly semantic and broadly object based versions were influenced by Tarski technical work on truth cf Field Popper Truthbearers Truthmakers Truth Truthbearers Correspondence theories of truth have been given for beliefs thoughts ideas judgments statements assertions utterances sentences and propositions It has become customary to talk of truthbearers whenever one wants to stay neutral between these choices Five points should be kept in mind The term truthbearer is somewhat misleading It is intended to refer to bearers of truth or falsehood truth value bearers or alternatively to things of which it makes sense to ask whether they are true or false thus allowing for the possibility that some of them might be neither One distinguishes between secondary and primary truthbearers Secondary truthbearers are those whose truth values truth or falsehood are derived from the truth values of primary truthbearers whose truth values are not derived from any other truthbearers Consequently the term true is usually regarded as ambiguous taking its primary meaning when applied to primary truthbearers and various secondary meanings when applied to other truthbearers This is however not a brute ambiguity since the secondary meanings are supposed to be derived definable from the primary meaning together with additional relations For example one might hold that propositions are true or false in the primary sense whereas sentences are true or false in a secondary sense insofar as they express propositions that are true or false in the primary sense The meanings of true when applied to truthbearers of different kinds are thus connected in a manner familiar from what Aristotelians called analogical uses of a term nowadays one would call this focal meaning healthy in healthy organism and healthy food the latter being defined as healthy in the secondary sense of contributing to the healthiness primary sense of an organism It is often unproblematic to advocate one theory of truth for bearers of one kind and another theory for bearers of a different kind a deflationary theory of truth or an identity theory applied to propositions could be a component of some form of correspondence theory of truth for sentences Different theories of truth applied to bearers of different kinds do not automatically compete The standard segregation of truth theories into competing camps found in textbooks handbooks and dictionaries proceeds under the assumption really a pretense that they are intended for primary truthbearers of the same kind Confusingly there is little agreement as to which entities are properly taken to be primary truthbearers Nowadays the main contenders are public language sentences sentences of the language of thought sentential mental representations and propositions Popular earlier contenders beliefs judgments statements and assertions have fallen out of favor mainly for two reasons The problem of logically complex truthbearers A subject may hold a disjunctive belief the baby will be a boy or the baby will be a girl while believing only one or neither of the disjuncts Also may hold a conditional belief if whales are fish then some fish are mammals without believing the antecedent or the consequent Also will usually hold a negative belief not everyone is lucky without believing what is negated In such cases the truth values of complex beliefs depend on the truth values of their constituents although the constituents may not be believed by or by anyone This means that a view according to which beliefs are primary truthbearers seems unable to account for how the truth values of complex beliefs are connected to the truth values of their simpler constituents to do this one needs to be able to apply truth and falsehood to belief constituents even when they are not believed This point which is equally fundamental for a proper understanding of logic was made by all early advocates of propositions cf Bolzano I Frege Husserl I Meinong The problem arises in much the same form for views that would take judgments statements or assertions as primary truthbearers The problem is not easily evaded Talk of unbelieved beliefs unjudged judgments unstated statements unasserted assertions is either absurd or simply amounts to talk of unbelieved unjudged unstated unasserted propositions or sentences It is noteworthy incidentally that quite a few philosophical proposals concerning truth as well as other matters run afoul of the simple observation that there are unasserted and unbelieved truthbearers cf Geach The duality of state content a a act object The noun belief can refer to the state of believing or to its content to what is believed If the former the state of believing can be said to be true or false at all which is highly questionable then only insofar as the latter what is believed is true or false Similarly for nouns referring to mental acts or their objects contents such as judgment statement and assertion Mental sentences were the preferred primary truthbearers throughout the medieval period They were neglected in the first half of the century but made a comeback in the second half through the revival of the representational theory of the mind especially in the form of the language of thought hypothesis cf Fodor Somewhat confusingly to us now for many centuries the term proposition propositio was reserved exclusively for sentences written spoken or mental This use was made official by Boethius in the century and is still found in Locke Essay in and in Mill Logic in Some time after that in Moore proposition switched sides the term now being used for what is said by uttering a sentence for what is believed judged stated assumed etc with occasional reversions to medieval usage in Russell Truthmakers Talk of truthmakers serves a function similar but correlative to talk of truthbearers A truthmaker is anything that makes some truthbearer true Different versions of the correspondence theory will have different and often competing views about what sort of items true truthbearers correspond to facts states of affairs events things tropes properties It is convenient to talk of truthmakers whenever one wants to stay neutral between these choices Four points should be kept in mind The notion of a truthmaker is tightly connected with and dependent on the relational notion of truthmaking a truthmaker is whatever stands in the truthmaking relation to some truthbearer Despite the causal overtones of maker and making this relation is usually not supposed to be a causal relation The terms truthmaking and truthmaker are ambiguous For illustration consider a classical correspondence theory on which is true if and only if corresponds to some fact One can say a that is made true by a fact namely the or a fact corresponds to One can also say that is made true by correspondence to a fact Both uses of is made true by are correct and both occur in discussions of truth But they are importantly different and must be distinguished The a use is usually the intended one it expresses a relation peculiar to truth and leads to a use of truthmaker that actually picks out the items that would normally be intended by those using the term The use does not express a relation peculiar to truth it is just an instance for true of the generic formula what makes an thing an that can be employed to elicit the definiens of a proposed definition of Compare what makes an even number even is its divisibility by what makes a right action right is its having better consequences than available alternative actions Note that anyone proposing a definition or account of truth can avail themselves of the notion of truthmaking in the sense a coherence theorist advocating that a belief is true if and only if it coheres with other beliefs can say what makes a true belief true is its coherence with other beliefs So on the use truthmaking and truthmaker do not signal any affinity with the basic idea underlying the correspondence theory of truth whereas on the a use these terms do signal such an affinity Talk of truthmaking and truthmakers goes well with the basic idea underlying the correspondence theory hence it might seem natural to describe a traditional fact based correspondence theory as maintaining that the truthmakers are facts and that the correspondence relation is the truthmaking relation However the assumption that the correspondence relation can be regarded as a species of the truthmaking relation is dubious Correspondence appears to be a symmetric relation if corresponds to then corresponds to whereas it is usually taken for granted that truthmaking is an asymmetric relation or at least not a symmetric one It is hard to see how a symmetric relation could be a species of an asymmetric or non symmetric relation cf David Talk of truthmaking and truthmakers is frequently employed during informal discussions involving truth but tends to be dropped when a more formal or official formulation of a theory of truth is produced one reason being that it seems circular to define or explain truth in terms of truthmakers or truthmaking However in recent years the informal talk has been turned into an official doctrine truthmaker theory This theory should be distinguished from informal truthmaker talk not everyone employing the latter would subscribe to the former Moreover truthmaker theory should not simply be assumed to be a version of the correspondence theory indeed some advocates present it as a competitor to the correspondence theory see below Section Truth The abstract noun truth has various uses a It can be used to refer to the general relational property otherwise referred to as being true though the latter label would be more perspicuous it is rarely used even in philosophical discussions The noun truth can be used to refer to the concept that picks out the property and is expressed in English by the adjective true Some authors do not distinguish between concept and property others do or should an account of the concept might differ significantly from an account of the property To mention just one example one might maintain with some plausibility that an account of the concept ought to succumb to the liar paradox see the entry on the liar paradox otherwise it wouldn be an adequate account of our concept of truth this idea is considerably less plausible in the case of the property Any proposed definition of truth might be intend as a definition of the property or of the concept or both its author may or may not be alive to the difference The noun truth can be used finally to refer to some set of true truthbarers possibly unknown as in The truth is out there and The truth about this matter will never be known Simple Versions of the Correspondence Theory The traditional centerpiece of any correspondence theory is a definition of truth Nowadays a correspondence definition is most likely intended as a real definition as a definition of the property which does not commit its advocate to the claim that the definition provides a synonym for the term true Most correspondence theorists would consider it implausible and unnecessarily bold to maintain that true means the same as corresponds with a fact Some simple forms of correspondence definitions of truth should be distinguished iff means if and only if the variable ranges over whatever truthbearers are taken as primary the notion of correspondence might be replaced by various related notions is true iff corresponds to some fact is false iff does not correspond to any fact is true iff corresponds to some state of affairs that obtains is false iff corresponds to some state of affairs that does not obtain Both forms invoke portions of reality facts states of affairs that are typically denoted by that clauses or by sentential gerundives viz the fact state of affairs that snow is white or the fact state of affairs of snow being white definition of falsehood is committed to there being existing entities of this sort that nevertheless fail to obtain such as snow being green definition of falsehood is not so committed to say that a fact does not obtain means at best that there is no such fact that no such fact exists It should be noted that this terminology is not standardized some authors use state of affairs much like fact is used here Armstrong The question whether non obtaining beings of the relevant sort are to be accepted is the substantive issue behind such terminological variations The difference between and is akin to the difference between Platonism about properties embraces uninstantiated properties and Aristotelianism about properties rejects uninstantiated properties Advocates of hold that facts are states of affairs that obtain they hold that their account of truth is in effect an analysis of account of truth So disagreement turns largely on the treatment of falsehood which simply identifies with the absence of truth The following points might be made for preferring over a Form does not imply that things outside the category of truthbearers tables dogs are false just because they don correspond to any facts One might think this flaw of is easily repaired just put an explicit specification of the desired category of truthbearers into both sides of However some worry that truthbearer categories declarative sentences or propositions cannot be defined without invoking truth and falsehood which would make the resultant definition implicitly circular Form allows for items within the category of truthbearers that are neither true nor false it allows for the failure of bivalence Some though not all will regard this as a significant advantage If the primary truthbearers are sentences or mental states then states of affairs could be their meanings or contents and the correspondence relation in could be understood accordingly as the relation of representation signification meaning or having as content Facts on the other hand cannot be identified with the meanings or contents of sentences or mental states on pain of the absurd consequence that false sentences and beliefs have no meaning or content Take a truth of the form or where is true and false What are the constituents of the corresponding fact Since is false they cannot both be facts cf Russell Form allows that the fact corresponding to or is an obtaining disjunctive state of affairs composed of a state of affairs that obtains and a state of affairs that does not obtain The main point in favor of over is that is not committed to counting non obtaining states of affairs like the state of affairs that snow is green as constituents of reality One might observe that strictly speaking and being biconditionals are not ontologically committed to anything Their respective commitments to facts and states of affairs arise only when they are combined with claims to the effect that there is something that is true and something that is false The discussion assumes some such claims as given Both forms and should be distinguished from is true iff corresponds to some fact that exists is false iff corresponds to some fact that does not exist which is a confused version of or a confused version of or if unconfused signals commitment to Meinongianism the thesis that there are things facts that do not exist The lure of stems from the desire to offer more than a purely negative correspondence account of falsehood while avoiding commitment to non obtaining states of affairs Moore at times succumbs to temptations pp but see It can also be found in the translation of Wittgenstein who uses state of affairs Sachverhalt to refer to atomic facts The translation has Wittgenstein saying that an elementary proposition is false when the corresponding state of affairs atomic fact does not exist but the German original of the same passage looks rather like a version of Somewhat ironically a definition of form reintroduces Plato problem of falsehood into a fact based correspondence theory into a theory of the sort that was supposed to provide an alternative solution to that very problem see Section A fourth simple form of correspondence definition was popular for a time cf Russell secs Broad IV Austin fn but seems to have fallen out of favor is true iff corresponds agrees with some fact is false iff mis corresponds disagrees with some fact This formulation attempts to avoid commitment to non obtaining states of affairs and commitment to non existent facts by invoking the relation of mis correspondence or disagreement to account for falsehood It differs from in that it attempts to keep items outside the intended category of from being false supposedly tables and dogs cannot mis correspond with a fact Main worries about are a its invocation of an additional potentially mysterious relation which seems difficult to tame Which fact is the one that mis corresponds with a given falsehood and What keeps a truth which by definition corresponds with some fact from also mis corresponding with some other fact from being a falsehood as well In the following I will treat definitions and as paradigmatic moreover since advocates of agree that obtaining states of affairs are facts it is often convenient to condense the correspondence theory into the simpler formula provided by truth is correspondence to a fact at least as long as one is not particularly concerned with issues raised by falsehood Arguments for the Correspondence Theory The main positive argument given by advocates of the correspondence theory of truth is its obviousness Descartes I have never had any doubts about truth because it seems a notion so transcendentally clear that nobody can be ignorant of it the word truth in the strict sense denotes the conformity of thought with its object AT II Even philosophers whose overall views may well lead one to expect otherwise tend to agree Kant The nominal definition of truth that it is the agreement of a cognition with its object is assumed as granted William James Truth as any dictionary will tell you is a property of certain of our ideas It means their agreement as falsity means their disagreement with reality Indeed The Oxford English Dictionary tells us Truth Conformity with fact agreement with reality In view of its claimed obviousness it would seem interesting to learn how popular the correspondence theory actually is There are some empirical data The PhilPapers Survey conducted in cf Bourget and Chalmers more specifically the part of the survey targeting all regular faculty members in leading departments of philosophy reports the following responses to the question Truth correspondence deflationary or epistemic Accept or lean toward correspondence deflationary other epistemic The data suggest that correspondence type theories may enjoy a weak majority among professional philosophers and that the opposition is divided This fits with the observation that typically discussions of the nature of truth take some version of the correspondence theory as the default view the view to be criticized or to be defended against criticism Historically the correspondence theory usually in an object based version was taken for granted so much so that it did not acquire this name until comparatively recently and explicit arguments for the view are very hard to find Since the comparatively recent arrival of apparently competing approaches correspondence theorists have developed negative arguments defending their view against objections and attacking sometimes ridiculing competing views Objections to the Correspondence Theory Objection Definitions like or are too narrow Although they apply to truths from some domains of discourse the domain of science they fail for others the domain of morality there are no moral facts The objection recognizes moral truths but rejects the idea that reality contains moral facts for moral truths to correspond to Logic provides another example of a domain that has been flagged in this way The logical positivists recognized logical truths but rejected logical facts Their intellectual ancestor Hume had already given two definitions of true one for logical truths broadly conceived the other for non logical truths Truth or falsehood consists in an agreement or disagreement either to the real relations of ideas or to real existence and matter of fact Hume Treatise cf see also Locke Essay for a similarly two pronged account but in terms of object based correspondence There are four possible responses to objections of this sort a Noncognitivism which says that despite appearances to the contrary claims from the flagged domain are not truth evaluable to begin with moral claims are commands or expressions of emotions disguised as truthbearers Error theory which says that all claims from the flagged domain are false Reductionism which says that truths from the flagged domain correspond to facts of a different domain regarded as unproblematic moral truths correspond to social behavioral facts logical truths correspond to facts about linguistic conventions and Standing firm embracing facts of the flagged domain The objection in effect maintains that there are different brands of truth of the property being true not just different brands of truths for different domains On the face of it this conflicts with the observation that there are many obviously valid arguments combining premises from flagged and unflagged domains The observation is widely regarded as refuting non cognitivism once the most popular concessive response to the objection In connection with this objection one should take note of the recently developed multiple realizability view of truth according to which truth is not to be identified with correspondence to fact but can be realized by correspondence to fact for truthbearers of some domains of discourse and by other properties for truthbearers of other domains of discourse including flagged domains Though it retains important elements of the correspondence theory this view does not strictly speaking offer a response to the objection on behalf of the correspondence theory and should be regarded as one of its competitors see below Section Objection Correspondence theories are too obvious They are trivial vacuous trading in mere platitudes Locutions from the corresponds to the facts family are used regularly in everyday language as idiomatic substitutes for true Such common turns of phrase should not be taken to indicate commitment to a correspondence theory in any serious sense Definitions like or merely condense some trivial idioms into handy formulas they don deserve the grand label theory there is no theoretical weight behind them cf Woozley chap Davidson Blackburn chap In response one could point out a Definitions like or are mini theories mini theories are quite common in philosophy and it is not at all obvious that they are vacuous merely because they are modeled on common usage There are correspondence theories that go beyond these definitions The complaint implies that definitions like and or are generally accepted and are moreover so shallow that they are compatible with any deeper theory of truth This makes it rather difficult to explain why some thinkers emphatically reject all correspondence formulations The objection implies that the correspondence of belief with a fact could be said to consist in the belief coherence with overall belief system This is wildly implausible even on the most shallow understanding of correspondence and fact Objection Correspondence theories are too obscure Objections of this sort which are the most common protest that the central notions of a correspondence theory carry unacceptable commitments and or cannot be accounted for in any respectable manner The objections can be divided into objections primarily aimed at the correspondence relation and its relatives and objections primarily aimed at the notions of fact or state of affairs The correspondence relation must be some sort of resemblance relation But truthbearers do not resemble anything in the world except other truthbearers echoing Berkeley an idea can be like nothing but an idea The correspondence relation is very mysterious it seems to reach into the most distant regions of space faster than light and time past and future How could such a relation possibly be accounted for within a naturalistic framework What physical relation could it possibly be Given the great variety of complex truthbearers a correspondence theory will be committed to all sorts of complex funny facts that are ontologically disreputable Negative disjunctive conditional universal probabilistic subjunctive and counterfactual facts have all given cause for complaint on this score All facts even the most simple ones are disreputable Fact talk being wedded to that clauses is entirely parasitic on truth talk Facts are too much like truthbearers Facts are fictions spurious sentence like slices of reality projected from true sentences for the sake of correspondence Quine cf Strawson Correspondence as Isomorphism Some correspondence theories of truth are two liner mini theories consisting of little more than a specific version of or Normally one would expect a bit more even from a philosophical theory though mini theories are quite common in philosophy One would expect a correspondence theory to go beyond a mere definition like or and discharge a triple task it should tell us about the workings of the correspondence relation about the nature of facts and about the conditions that determine which truthbearers correspond to which facts One can approach this by considering some general principles a correspondence theory might want to add to its central principle to flesh out her theory The first such principle says that the correspondence relation must not collapse into identity It takes two to make a truth Austin Nonidentity No truth is identical with a fact correspondence to which is sufficient for its being a truth It would be much simpler to say that no truth is identical with a fact However some authors Wittgenstein hold that a proposition Satz his truthbearer is itself a fact though not the same fact as the one that makes the proposition true see also King Nonidentity is usually taken for granted by correspondence theorists as constitutive of the very idea of a correspondence theory authors who advance contrary arguments to the effect that correspondence must collapse into identity regard their arguments as objections to any form of correspondence theory cf Moore Frege Concerning the correspondence relation two aspects can be distinguished correspondence as correlation and correspondence as isomorphism cf Pitcher Kirkham chap Pertaining to the first aspect familiar from mathematical contexts a correspondence theorist is likely to adopt claim a and some may in addition adopt claim of Correlation a Every truth corresponds to exactly one fact Different truths correspond to different facts Together a and say that correspondence is a one one relation This seems needlessly strong and it is not easy to find real life correspondence theorists who explicitly embrace part Why shouldn different truths correspond to the same fact as long as they are not too different Explicit commitment to a is also quite rare However correspondence theorists tend to move comfortably from talk about a given truth to talk about the fact it corresponds to a move that signals commitment to a Correlation does not imply anything about the inner nature of the corresponding items Contrast this with correspondence as isomorphism which requires the corresponding items to have the same or sufficiently similar constituent structure This aspect of correspondence which is more prominent and more notorious than the previous one is also much more difficult to make precise Let us say roughly that a correspondence theorist may want to add a claim to her theory committing her to something like the following Structure If an item of kind corresponds to a certain fact then they have the same or sufficiently similar structure the overall correspondence between a true and a fact is a matter of part wise correspondences of their having corresponding constituents in corresponding places in the same structure or in sufficiently similar structures The basic idea is that truthbearers and facts are both complex structured entities truthbearers are composed of other truthbearers and ultimately of words or concepts facts are composed of other facts or states of affairs and ultimately of things properties and relations The aim is to show how the correspondence relation is generated from underlying relations between the ultimate constituents of truthbearers on the one hand and the ultimate constituents of their corresponding facts on the other One part of the project will be concerned with these correspondence generating relations it will lead into a theory that addresses the question how simple words or concepts can be about things properties and relations it will merge with semantics or psycho semantics depending on what the truthbearers are taken to be The other part of the project the specifically ontological part will have to provide identity criteria for facts and explain how their simple constituents combine into complex wholes Putting all this together should yield an account of the conditions determining which truthbearers correspond to which facts Correlation and Structure reflect distinct aspects of correspondence One might want to endorse the former without the latter though it is hard to see how one could endorse the latter without embracing at least part a of the former The isomorphism approach offers an answer to objection Although the truth that the cat is on the mat does not resemble the cat or the mat the truth doesn meow or smell etc it does resemble the fact that the cat is on the mat This is not a qualitative resemblance it is a more abstract structural resemblance The approach also puts objection in some perspective The correspondence relation is supposed to reduce to underlying relations between words or concepts and reality Consequently a correspondence theory is little more than a spin off from semantics and or psycho semantics the theory of intentionality construed as incorporating a representational theory of the mind cf Fodor This reminds us that as a relation correspondence is no more but also no less mysterious than semantic relations in general Such relations have some curious features and they raise a host of puzzles and difficult questions most notoriously Can they be explained in terms of natural causal relations or do they have to be regarded as irreducibly non natural aspects of reality Some philosophers have claimed that semantic relations are too mysterious to be taken seriously usually on the grounds that they are not explainable in naturalistic terms But one should bear in mind that this is a very general and extremely radical attack on semantics as a whole on the very idea that words and concepts can be about things The common practice to aim this attack specifically at the correspondence theory seems misleading As far as the intelligibility of the correspondence relation is concerned the correspondence theory will stand or fall with the general theory of reference and intentionality It should be noted though that these points concerning objections and are not independent of one views about the nature of the primary truthbearers If truthbearers are taken to be sentences of an ordinary language or an idealized version thereof or if they are taken to be mental representations sentences of the language of thought the above points hold without qualification correspondence will be a semantic or psycho semantic relation If on the other hand the primary truthbearers are taken to be propositions there is a complication On a broadly Fregean view of propositions propositions are constituted by concepts of objects and properties in the logical not the psychological sense of concept On this view the above points still hold since the relation between concepts on the one hand and the objects and properties they are concepts of on the other appears to be a semantic relation a concept semantic relation On the so called Russellian view of propositions which the early Russell inherited mostly from early Moore propositions are constituted not of concepts of objects and properties but of the objects and properties themselves cf Russell On this view the points above will most likely fail since the correspondence relation would appear to collapse into the identity relation when applied to true Russellian propositions It is hard to see how a true Russellian proposition could be anything but a fact What would a fact be if not this sort of thing So the principle of Nonidentity is rejected and with it goes the correspondence theory of truth Once it is definitely recognized that the proposition is to denote not a belief or form of words but an object of belief it seems plain that a truth differs in no respect from the reality with which it was supposed merely to correspond Moore A simple fact based correspondence theory applied to propositions understood in the Russellian way thus reduces to an identity theory of truth on which a proposition is true iff it is a fact and false iff it is not a fact See below Section and the entries on propositions singular propositions and structured propositions in this encyclopedia But Russellians don usually renounce the correspondence theory entirely Though they have no room for from Section when applied to propositions as truthbearers correspondence will enter into their account of truth for sentences public or mental The account will take the form of Section applied to categories of truthbearers other than propositions where Russellian propositions show up on the right hand side in the guise of states of affairs that obtain or fail to obtain Commitment to states of affairs in addition to propositions is sometimes regarded with scorn as a gratuitous ontological duplication But Russellians are not committed to states of affairs in addition to propositions for propositions on their view must already be states of affairs This conclusion is well nigh inevitable once true propositions have been identified with facts If a true proposition is a fact then a false proposition that might have been true would have been a fact if it had been true So a contingent false proposition must be the same kind of being as a fact only not a fact an unfact but that just is a non obtaining state of affairs under a different name Russellian propositions are states of affairs the false ones are states of affairs that do not obtain and the true ones are states of affairs that do obtain The Russellian view of propositions is popular nowadays Somewhat curiously contemporary Russellians hardly ever refer to propositions as facts or states of affairs This is because they are much concerned with understanding belief belief attributions and the semantics of sentences In such contexts it is more natural to talk proposition language than state of affairs language It feels odd wrong to say that someone believes a state of affairs or that states of affairs are true or false For that matter it also feels odd wrong to say that some propositions are facts that facts are true and that propositions obtain or fail to obtain Nevertheless all of this must be the literal truth according to the Russellians They have to claim that proposition and state of affairs much like evening star and morning star are different names for the same things they come with different associations and are at home in somewhat different linguistic environments which accounts for the felt oddness when one name is transported to the other environment Returning to the isomorphism approach in general on a strict or na√Øve implementation of this approach correspondence will be a one one relation between truths and corresponding facts which leaves the approach vulnerable to objections against funny facts each true truthbearer no matter how complex will be assigned a matching fact Moreover since a strict implementation of isomorphism assigns corresponding entities to all relevant constituents of truthbearers complex facts will contain objects corresponding to the logical constants not or if then etc and these logical objects will have to be regarded as constituents of the world Many philosophers have found it hard to believe in the existence of all these funny facts and funny quasi logical objects The isomorphism approach has never been advocated in a fully na√Øve form assigning corresponding objects to each and every wrinkle of our verbal or mental utterings Instead proponents try to isolate the relevant constituents of truthbearers through meaning analysis aiming to uncover the logical form or deep structure behind ordinary language and thought This deep structure might then be expressed in an ideal language typically the language of predicate logic whose syntactic structure is designed to mirror perfectly the ontological structure of reality The resulting view correspondence as isomorphism between properly analyzed truthbearers and facts avoids assigning strange objects to such phrases as the average husband the sake of and the present king of France but the view remains committed to logically complex facts and to logical objects corresponding to the logical constants Austin rejects the isomorphism approach on the grounds that it projects the structure of our language onto the world On his version of the correspondence theory a more elaborated variant of applied to statements a statement as a whole is correlated to a state of affairs by arbitrary linguistic conventions without mirroring the inner structure of its correlate cf also Vision This approach appears vulnerable to the objection that it avoids funny facts at the price of neglecting systematicity Language does not provide separate linguistic conventions for each statement that would require too vast a number of conventions Rather it seems that the truth values of statements are systematically determined via a relatively small set of conventions by the semantic values relations to reality of their simpler constituents Recognition of this systematicity is built right into the isomorphism approach Critics frequently echo Austin projection complaint that a traditional correspondence theory commits the error of reading back into the world the features of language Austin cf also Rorty At bottom this is a pessimistic stance if there is a prima facie structural resemblance between a mode of speech or thought and some ontological category it is inferred pessimistically that the ontological category is an illusion a matter of us projecting the structure of our language or thought into the world Advocates of traditional correspondence theories can be seen as taking the opposite stance unless there are specific reasons to the contrary they are prepared to assume optimistically that the structure of our language and or thought reflects genuine ontological categories that the structure of our language and or thought is at least to a significant extent the way it is because of the structure of the world Modified Versions of the Correspondence Theory Logical Atomism Wittgenstein and Russell propose modified fact based correspondence accounts of truth as part of their program of logical atomism Such accounts proceed in two stages At the first stage the basic truth definition say from Section is restricted to a special subclass of truthbearers the so called elementary or atomic truthbearers whose truth is said to consist in their correspondence to atomic facts if is elementary then is true iff corresponds to some atomic fact This restricted definition serves as the base clause for truth conditional recursion clauses given at the second stage at which the truth values of non elementary or molecular truthbearers are explained recursively in terms of their logical structure and the truth values of their simpler constituents For example a sentence of the form not is true iff is false a sentence of the form and is true iff is true and is true a sentence of the form or is true iff is true or is true etc These recursive clauses called truth conditions can be reapplied until the truth of a non elementary molecular sentence of arbitrary complexity is reduced to the truth or falsehood of its elementary atomic constituents Logical atomism exploits the familiar rules enshrined in the truth tables for evaluating complex formulas on the basis of their simpler constituents These rules can be understood in two different ways a as tracing the ontological relations between complex facts and constituent simpler facts or as tracing logico semantic relations exhibiting how the truth values of complex sentences can be explained in terms of their logical relations to simpler constituent sentences together with the correspondence and non correspondence of simple elementary sentences to atomic facts Logical atomism takes option Logical atomism is designed to go with the ontological view that the world is the totality of atomic facts cf Wittgenstein thus accommodating objection by doing without funny facts atomic facts are all the facts there are although real life atomists tend to allow conjunctive facts regarding them as mere aggregates of atomic facts An elementary truth is true because it corresponds to an atomic fact correspondence is still isomorphism but it holds exclusively between elementary truths and atomic facts There is no match between truths and facts at the level of non elementary molecular truths or and or might all be true merely because corresponds to a fact The trick for avoiding logically complex facts lies in not assigning any entities to the logical constants Logical complexity so the idea goes belongs to the structure of language and or thought it is not a feature of the world This is expressed by Wittgenstein in an often quoted passage My fundamental idea is that the logical constants are not representatives that there can be no representatives of the logic of facts and also by Russell You must not look about the real world for an object which you can call or and say Now look at this This is or Though accounts of this sort are naturally classified as versions of the correspondence theory it should be noted that they are strictly speaking in conflict with the basic forms presented in Section According to logical atomism it is not the case that for every truth there is a corresponding fact It is however still the case that the being true of every truth is explained in terms of correspondence to a fact or non correspondence to any fact together with in the case of molecular truths logical notions detailing the logical structure of complex truthbearers Logical atomism attempts to avoid commitment to logically complex funny facts via structural analysis of truthbearers It should not be confused with a superficially similar account maintaining that molecular facts are ultimately constituted by atomic facts The latter account would admit complex facts offering an ontological analysis of their structure and would thus be compatible with the basic forms presented in Section because it would be compatible with the claim that for every truth there is a corresponding fact For more on classical logical atomism see Wisdom Urmson and the entries on Russell logical atomism and Wittgenstein logical atomism in this encyclopedia While Wittgenstein and Russell seem to have held that the constituents of atomic facts are to be determined on the basis of a priori considerations Armstrong advocates an a posteriori form of logical atomism On his view atomic facts are composed of particulars and simple universals properties and relations The latter are objective features of the world that ground the objective resemblances between particulars and explain their causal powers Accordingly what particulars and universals there are will have to be determined on the basis of total science Problems Logical atomism is not easy to sustain and has rarely been held in a pure form Among its difficulties are the following a What exactly are the elementary truthbearers How are they determined There are molecular truthbearers such as subjunctives and counterfactuals that tend to provoke the funny fact objection but cannot be handled by simple truth conditional clauses because their truth values do not seem to be determined by the truth values of their elementary constituents Are there universal facts corresponding to true universal generalizations Wittgenstein disapproves of universal facts apparently he wants to re analyze universal generalizations as infinite conjunctions of their instances Russell and Armstrong reject this analysis they admit universal facts Negative truths are the most notorious problem case because they clash with an appealing principle the truthmaker principle cf Section which says that for every truth there must be something in the world that makes it true every true truthbearer must have a truthmaker Suppose is elementary On the account given above not is true iff is false iff does not correspond to any fact hence not if true is not made true by any fact it does not seem to have a truthmaker Russell finds himself driven to admit negative facts regarded by many as paradigmatically disreputable portions of reality Wittgenstein sometimes talks of atomic facts that do not exist and calls their very nonexistence a negative fact cf but this is hardly an atomic fact itself Armstrong chap chaps holds that negative truths are made true by a second order totality fact which says of all the positive first order facts that they are all the first order facts Atomism and the Russellian view of propositions see Section By the time Russell advocated logical atomism around he had given up on what is now referred to as the Russellian conception of propositions which he and Moore held around But Russellian propositons are popular nowadays Note that logical atomism is not for the friends of Russellian propositions The argument is straightforward We have logically complex beliefs some of which are true According to the friends of Russellian propositions the contents of our beliefs are Russellian propositions and the contents of our true beliefs are true Russellian propositions Since true Russellian propositions are facts there must be at least as many complex facts as there are true beliefs with complex contents and at least as many complex states of affairs as there are true or false beliefs with complex contents Atomism may work for sentences public or mental and for Fregean propositions but not for Russellian propositions Logical atomism is designed to address objections to funny facts It is not designed to address objections to facts in general Here logical atomists will respond by defending atomic facts According to one defense facts are needed because mere objects are not sufficiently articulated to serve as truthmakers If a were the sole truthmaker of a is then the latter should imply a is for any So the truthmaker for a is needs at least to involve a and Fness But since Fness is a universal it could be instantiated in another object hence the mere existence of a and Fness is not sufficient for making true the claim a is a and Fness need to be tied together in the fact of a being Armstrong and Olson also maintain that facts are needed to make sense of the tie that binds particular objects to universals In this context it is usually emphasized that facts do not supervene on hence are not reducible to their constituents Facts are entities over and above the particulars and universals of which they are composed a loving and loving a are not the same fact even though they have the very same constituents Another defense of facts surprisingly rare would point out that many facts are observable one can see that the cat is on the mat and this is different from seeing the cat or the mat or both The objection that many facts are not observable would invite the rejoinder that many objects are not observable either See Austin Vendler chap and Vision chap for more discussion of anti fact arguments see also the entry facts in this encyclopedia Some atomists propose an atomistic version of definition but without facts because they regard facts as slices of reality too suspiciously sentence like to be taken with full ontological seriousness Instead they propose events and or objects plus tropes a a modes particularized qualities moments as the corresponding portions of reality It is claimed that these items are more thingy than facts but still sufficiently articulated and sufficiently abundant to serve as adequate truthmakers cf Mulligan Simons and Smith Logical Subatomism Logical atomism aims at getting by without logically complex truthmakers by restricting definitions like or from Section to elementary truthbearers and accounting for the truth values of molecular truthbearers recursively in terms of their logical structure and atomic truthmakers atomic facts events objects plus tropes More radical modifications of the correspondence theory push the recursive strategy even further entirely discarding definitions like or and hence the need for atomic truthmakers by going as it were subatomic Such accounts analyze truthbearers sentences into their subsentential constituents and dissolve the relation of correspondence into appropriate semantic subrelations names refer to or denote objects predicates open sentences apply to or are satisfied by objects Satisfaction of complex predicates can be handled recursively in terms of logical structure and satisfaction of simpler constituent predicates an object satisfies is not iff does not satisfy is satisfies is or is iff satisfies is or satisfies is and so on These recursions are anchored in a base clause addressing the satisfaction of primitive predicates an object satisfies is iff instantiates the property expressed by Some would prefer a more nominalistic base clause for satisfaction hoping to get by without seriously invoking properties Truth for singular sentences consisting of a name and an arbitrarily complex predicate is defined thus A singular sentence is true iff the object denoted by the name satisfies the predicate Logical machinery provided by Tarski can be used to turn this simplified sketch into a more general definition of truth a definition that handles sentences containing relational predicates and quantifiers and covers molecular sentences as well Whether Tarski own definition of truth can be regarded as a correspondence definition even in this modified sense is under debate cf Popper Field Kirkham chaps Soames K√ºnne chap Patterson Subatomism constitutes a return to broadly object based correspondence Since it promises to avoid facts and all similarly articulated sentence like slices of reality correspondence theorists who take seriously objection favor this approach not even elementary truthbearers are assigned any matching truthmakers The correspondence relation itself has given way to two semantic relations between constituents of truthbearers and objects reference or denotation and satisfaction relations central to any semantic theory Some advocates envision causal accounts of reference and satisfaction cf Field Devitt Schmitt Kirkham chaps It turns out that relational predicates require talk of satisfaction by ordered sequences of objects Davidson maintains that satisfaction by sequences is all that remains of the traditional idea of correspondence to facts he regards reference and satisfaction as theoretical constructs not in need of causal or any explanation Problems a The subatomistic approach accounts for the truth values of molecular truthbearers in the same way as the atomistic approach consequently molecular truthbearers that are not truth functional still pose the same problems as in atomism Belief attributions and modal claims pose special problems it seems that believes is a relational predicate so that John believes that snow is white is true iff believes is satisfied by John and the object denoted by that snow is white but the latter appears to be a proposition or state of affairs which threatens to let in through the back door the very sentence like slices of reality the subatomic approach was supposed to avoid thus undermining the motivation for going subatomic The phenomenon of referential indeterminacy threatens to undermine the idea that the truth values of elementary truthbearers are always determined by the denotation and or satisfaction of their constituents pre relativistic uses of the term mass are plausibly taken to lack determinate reference referring determinately neither to relativistic mass nor to rest mass yet a claim like The mass of the earth is greater than the mass of the moon seems to be determinately true even when made by Newton cf Field Problems for both versions of modified correspondence theories a It is not known whether an entirely general recursive definition of truth one that covers all truthbearers can be made available This depends on unresolved issues concerning the extent to which truthbearers are amenable to the kind of structural analyses that are presupposed by the recursive clauses The more an account of truth wants to exploit the internal structure of truthbearers the more it will be hostage to the limited availability of appropriate structural analyses of the relevant truthbearers Any account of truth employing a recursive framework may be virtually committed to taking sentences maybe sentences of the language of thought as primary truthbearers After all the recursive clauses rely heavily on what appears to be the logico syntactic structure of truthbearers and it is unclear whether anything but sentences can plausibly be said to possess that kind of structure But the thesis that sentences of any sort are to be regarded as the primary truthbearers is contentious Whether propositions can meaningfully be said to have an analogous albeit non linguistic structure is under debate cf Russell King If clauses like or is true iff is true or is true are to be used in a recursive account of our notion of truth as opposed to some other notion it has to be presupposed that or expresses disjunction one cannot define or and true at the same time To avoid circularity a modified correspondence theory be it atomic or subatomic must hold that the logical connectives can be understood without reference to correspondence truth Relocating Correspondence Definitions like and from Section assume naturally that truthbearers are true because they the truthbearers themselves correspond to facts There are however views that reject this natural assumption They propose to account for the truth of truthbearers of certain kinds propositions not by way of their correspondence to facts but by way of the correspondence to facts of other items the ones that have propositions as their contents Consider the state of believing that or the activity of judging that The state the activity is not strictly speaking true or false rather what is true or false is its content the proposition that Nevertheless on the present view it is the state of believing that that corresponds or fails to correspond to a fact So truth falsehood for propositions can be defined in the following manner is a true false proposition iff there is a belief state such that is the content of and corresponds fails to correspond to a fact Such a modification of fact based correspondence can be found in Moore and Armstrong iv It can be adapted to atomistic Armstrong and subatomistic views and to views on which sentences of the language of thought are the primary bearers of truth and falsehood However by taking the content carrying states as the primary corresponders it entails that there are no truths falsehoods that are not believed by someone Most advocates of propositions as primary bearers of truth and falsehood will regard this as a serious weakness holding that there are very many true and false propositions that are not believed or even entertained by anyone Armstrong combines the view with an instrumentalist attitude towards propositions on which propositions are mere abstractions from mental states and should not be taken seriously ontologically speaking The Correspondence Theory and Its Competitors Traditional Competitors Against the traditional competitors coherentist pragmatist and verificationist and other epistemic theories of truth correspondence theorists raise two main sorts of objections First such accounts tend to lead into relativism Take a coherentist account of truth Since it is possible that coheres with the belief system of while not coheres with the belief system of the coherentist account seems to imply absurdly that contradictories and not could both be true To avoid embracing contradictions coherentists often commit themselves if only covertly to the objectionable relativistic view that is true for and not is true for Second the accounts tend to lead into some form of idealism or anti realism it is possible for the belief that to cohere with someone belief system even though it is not a fact that also it is possible for it to be a fact that even if no one believes that at all or if the belief does not cohere with anyone belief system Cases of this sort are frequently cited as counterexamples to coherentist accounts of truth Dedicated coherentists tend to reject such counterexamples insisting that they are not possible after all Since it is hard to see why they would not be possible unless its being a fact that were determined by the belief coherence with other beliefs this reaction commits them to the anti realist view that the facts are largely determined by what we believe This offers a bare outline of the overall shape the debates tend to take For more on the correspondence theory vs its traditional competitors see Vision Kirkham chaps Schmitt K√ºnne chap and essays in Lynch Walker is a book lenght discussion of coherence theories of truth See also the entries on pragmatism relativism the coherence theory of truth in this encyclopedia Pluralism The correspondence theory is sometimes accused of overreaching itself it does apply so the objection goes to truths from some domains of discourse scientific discourse and or discourse about everyday midsized physical things but not to truths from various other domains of discourse ethical and or aesthetic discourse see the first objection in Section above Alethic pluralism grows out of this objection maintaining that truth is constituted by different properties for true propositions from different domains of discourse by correspondence to fact for true propositions from the domain of scientific or everyday discourse about physical things by some epistemic property such as coherence or superassertibility for true propositions from the domain of ethical and aesthetic discourse and maybe by still other properties for other domains of discourse This suggests a position on which the term true is multiply ambiguous expressing different properties when applied to propositions from different domains However contemporary pluralists reject this problematic idea maintaining instead that truth is multiply realizable That is the term true is univocal it expresses one concept or property truth being true but one that can be realized by or manifested in different properties correspondence to fact coherence or superassertibility and maybe others for true propositions from different domains of discourse Truth itself is not to be identified with any of its realizing properties Instead it is characterized quasi axiomatically by a set of alleged platitudes including according to Crispin Wright version transparency to assert is to present as true contrast a proposition may be true without being justified and timelesness if a proposition is ever true then it always is absoluteness there is no such thing as a proposition being more or less true and others Though it contains the correspondence theory as one ingredient alethic pluralism is nevertheless a genuine competitor for it rejects the thesis that truth is correspondence to reality Moreover it equally contains competitors of the correspondence theory as further ingredients Alethic pluralism in its contemporary form is a relatively young position It was inaugurated by Crispin Wright see also and was later developed into a somewhat different form by Lynch Critical discussion is still at a relatively nascent stage but see Vision chap for extended discussion of Wright It will likely focus on two main problem areas First it seems difficult to sort propositions into distinct kinds according to the subject matter they are about Take the proposition that killing is morally wrong or the proposition that immoral acts happen in space time What are they about Intuitively their subject matter is mixed belonging to the physical domain the biological domain and the domain of ethical discourse It is hard to see how pluralism can account for the truth of such mixed propositions belonging to more than one domain of discourse What will be the realizing property Second pluralists are expected to explain how the platitudes can be converted into an account of truth itself Lynch proposes to construe truth as a functional property defined in terms of a complex functional role which is given by the conjunction of the platitudes somewhat analogous to the way in which functionalists in the philosophy of mind construe mental states as functional states specified in terms of their functional roles though in their case the relevant functional roles are causal roles which is not a feasible option when it comes to the truth role Here the main issue will be to determine a whether such an account really works when the technical details are laid out and whether it is plausible to claim that properties as different as correspondence to a fact on the one hand and coherence or superassertibilty on the other can be said to play one and the same role a claim that seems required by the thesis that these different properties all realize the same property being true For more on pluralism see the essays in Monnoyer and in Pedersen Wright and the entry on pluralist theories of truth in this encyclopedia The Identity Theory of Truth According to the identity theory of truth true propositions do not correspond to facts they are facts the true proposition that snow is white the fact that snow is white This non traditional competitor of the correspondence theory threatens to collapse the correspondence relation into identity See Moore and Dodd for a book length defense of this theory and discussion contrasting it with the correspondence theory and see the entry the identity theory of truth in this encyclopedia In response a correspondence theorist will point out a The identity theory is defensible only for propositions as truthbearers and only for propositions construed in a certain way namely as having objects and properties as constituents rather than ideas or concepts of objects and properties that is for Russellian propositions Hence there will be ample room and need for correspondence accounts of truth for other types of truthbearers including propositions if they are construed as constituted partly or wholly of concepts of objects and properties The identity theory is committed to the unacceptable consequence that facts are true The identity theory rests on the assumption that that clauses always denote propositions so that the that clause in the fact that snow is white denotes the proposition that snow is white The assumption can be questioned That clauses can be understood as ambiguous names sometimes denoting propositions and sometimes denoting facts The descriptive phrases the proposition and the fact can be regarded as serving to disambiguate the succeeding ambiguous that clauses much like the descriptive phrases in the philosopher Socrates and the soccer player Socrates serve to disambiguate the ambiguous name Socrates cf David Deflationism About Truth At present the most noticeable competitors to correspondence theories are deflationary accounts of truth or true Deflationists maintain that correspondence theories need to be deflated that their central notions correspondence and fact and their relatives play no legitimate role in an adequate account of truth and can be excised without loss A correspondence type formulation like Snow is white is true iff it corresponds to the fact that snow is white is to be deflated to Snow is white is true iff snow is white which according to deflationists says all there is to be said about the truth of Snow is white without superfluous embellishments cf Quine Correspondence theorists protest that cannot lead to anything deserving to be regarded as an account of truth It is concerned with only one particular sentence Snow is white and it resists generalization is a substitution instance of the schema is true iff which does not actually say anything itself it is not truth evaluable and cannot be turned into a genuine generalization about truth because of its essential reliance on the schematic letter a mere placeholder The attempt to turn into a generalization produces nonsense along the lines of For every is true iff or requires invocation of truth Every substitution instance of the schema is true iff is true Moreover no genuine generalizations about truth can be accounted for on the basis of Correspondence definitions on the other hand do yield genuine generalizations about truth Note that definitions like and in Section employ ordinary objectual variables not mere schematic placeholders the definitions are easily turned into genuine generalizations by prefixing the quantifier phrase For every which is customarily omitted in formulations intended as definitions It should be noted that the deflationist starting point which lends itself to deflating excisions actually misrepresents the correspondence theory According to corresponding to the fact that snow is white is sufficient and necessary for Snow is white to be true Yet according to and it is sufficient but not necessary Snow is white will be true as long as it corresponds to some fact or other The genuine article or is not as easily deflated as the impostor The debate turns crucially on the question whether anything deserving to be called an account or theory of truth ought to take the form of a genuine generalization and ought to be able to account for genuine generalizations involving truth Correspondence theorists tend to regard this as a minimal requirement Deflationists argue that truth is a shallow sometimes logical notion a notion that has no serious explanatory role to play as such it does not require a full fledged account a real theory that would have to take the form of a genuine generalization There is now a substantial body of literature on truth deflationism in general and its relation to the correspondence theory in particular the following is a small selection Quine Devitt Field Horwich Kirkham Gupta David Schmitt K√ºnne chap Rami Relevant essays are contained in Blackburn and Simmons Schantz Armour Garb and Beall and Wright and Pedersen See also the entry the deflationary theory of truth in this encyclopedia Truthmaker Theory This approach centers on the truthmaker or truthmaking principle Every truth has a truthmaker or alternatively For every truth there is something that makes it true The principle is usually understood as an expression of a realist attitude emphasizing the crucial contribution the world makes to the truth of a proposition Advocates tend to treat truthmaker theory primarily as a guide to ontology asking To entities of what ontological categories are we committed as truthmakers of the propositions we accept as true Most advocates maintain that propositions of different logical types can be made true by items from different ontological categories propositions of some types are made true by facts others just by individual things others by events others by tropes cf Armstrong This is claimed as a significant improvement over traditional correspondence theories which are understood correctly in most but by no means all cases to be committed to all truthmakers belonging to a single ontological category albeit disagreeing about which category that is All advocates of truthmaker theory maintain that the truthmaking relation is not one one but many many some truths are made true by more than one truthmaker some truthmakers make true more than one truth This is also claimed as a significant improvement over traditional correspondence theories which are often portrayed as committed to correspondence being a one one relation This portrayal is only partly justified While it is fairly easy to find real life correspondence theorists committing themselves to the view that each truth corresponds to exactly one fact at least by implication talking about the corresponding fact it is difficult to find real life correspondence theorists committing themselves to the view that only one truth can correspond to a given fact but see Moore A truthmaker theory may be presented as a competitor to the correspondence theory or as a version of the correspondence theory This depends considerably on how narrowly or broadly one construes correspondence theory on terminological issues Some advocates would agree with Dummett who said that although we have nowadays abandoned the correspondence theory of truth it nevertheless expresses one important feature of the concept of truth that a statement is true only if there is something in the world in virtue of which it is true Other advocates would follow Armstrong who tends to present his truthmaker theory as a liberal form of correspondence theory indeed he seems committed to the view that the truth of a contingent elementary proposition consists in its correspondence with some atomic fact cf Armstrong pp It is not easy to find a substantive difference between truthmaker theory and various brands of the sort of modified correspondence theory treated above under the heading Logical Atomism see Section Logical atomists such as Russell and Wittgenstein will hold that the truth or falsehood of every truth value bearer can be explained in terms of can be derived from logical relations between truth value bearers by way of the recursive clauses together with the base clauses the correspondence and non correspondence of elementary truth value bearers with facts This recursive strategy could be pursued with the aim to reject the truthmaker principle not all truths have truthmakers only elementary truths have truthmakers here understood as corresponding atomic facts But it could also be pursued and this seems to have been Russell intention at the time with the aim to secure the truthmaker principle even though the simple correspondence definition has been abandoned not every truth corresponds to a fact only elementary truths do but every truth has a truthmaker where the recursive clauses are supposed to show how truthmaking without correspondence but grounded in correspondence comes about There is one straightforward difference between truthmaker theory and most correspondence theories The latter are designed to answer the question What is truth Simple unmodified correspondence theories center on a biconditional such as is true iff corresponds to a fact intended to convey a definition of truth at least a real definition which does not commit them to the claim that the term true is synonymous with corresponds to a fact especially nowadays most correspondence theorists would consider such a claim to be implausibly and unnecessarily bold Modified correspondence theories also aim at providing a definition of truth though in their case the definition will be considerably more complex owing to the recursive character of the account Truthmaker theory on the other hand centers on the truthmaker principle For every truth there is something that makes it true Though this principle will deliver the biconditional is true iff something makes true since something makes true trivially implies is true this does not yield a promising candidate for a definition of truth defining truth in terms of truthmaking would appear to be circular Unlike most correspondence theories truthmaker theory is not equipped and usually not designed to answer the question What is truth at least not if one expects the answer to take the form of a feasible candidate for a definition of truth There is a growing body of literature on truthmaker theory see for example Russell Mullligan Simons and Smith Fox Armstrong Merricks and the essays in Beebe and Dodd Monnoyer and in Lowe and Rami See also the entry on truthmakers in this encyclopedia More Objections to the Correspondence Theory Two final objections to the correspondence theory deserve separate mention The Big Fact Inspired by an allegedly similar argument of Frege Davidson argues that the correspondence theory is bankrupt because it cannot avoid the consequence that all true sentences correspond to the same fact the Big Fact The argument is based on two crucial assumptions Logically equivalent sentences can be substituted salva veritate in the context the fact that and ii If two singular terms denoting the same thing can be substituted for each other in a given sentence salva veritate they can still be so substituted if that sentence is embedded within the context the fact that In the version below the relevant singular terms will be the following the such that Diogenes and the such that Diogenes Now assume that a given sentence corresponds to the fact that and assume that and are sentences with the same truth value We have corresponds to the fact that which by implies corresponds to the fact that the such that Diogenes the such that Diogenes which by ii implies corresponds to the fact that the such that Diogenes the such that Diogenes which by implies corresponds to the fact that Since the only restriction on was that it have the same truth value as it would follow that any sentence that corresponds to any fact corresponds to every fact so that all true sentences correspond to the same facts thereby proving the emptiness of the correspondence theory the conclusion of the argument is taken as tantamount to the conclusion that every true sentence corresponds to the totality of all the facts the Big Fact the world as a whole This argument belongs to a type now called slingshot arguments because a giant opponent is brought down by a single small weapon allegedly The first versions of this type of argument were given by Church and G√∂del it was later adapted by Quine in his crusade against quantified modal logic Davidson is offering yet another adaption this time involving the expression corresponds to the fact that The argument has been criticized repeatedly Critics point to the two questionable assumptions on which it relies and ii It is far from obvious why a correspondence theorist should be tempted by either one of them Opposition to assumption rests on the view that expressibility by logically equivalent sentences may be a necessary but is not a sufficient condition for fact identity Opposition to assumption ii rests on the observation that the alleged singular terms used in the argument are definite descriptions their status as genuine singular terms is in doubt and it is well known that they behave rather differently than proper names for which assumption ii is probably valid cf Follesdal Olson K√ºnne and especially the extended discussion and criticism in Neale The objection that may well have been the most effective in causing discontent with the correspondence theory is based on an epistemological concern In a nutshell the objection is that a correspondence theory of truth must inevitably lead into skepticism about the external world because the required correspondence between our thoughts and reality is not ascertainable Ever since Berkeley attack on the representational theory of the mind objections of this sort have enjoyed considerable popularity It is typically pointed out that we cannot step outside our own minds to compare our thoughts with mind independent reality Yet so the objection continues on the correspondence theory of truth this is precisely what we would have to do to gain knowledge We would have to access reality as it is in itself independently of our cognition and determine whether our thoughts correspond to it Since this is impossible since all our access to the world is mediated by our cognition the correspondence theory makes knowledge impossible cf Kant intro vii Assuming that the resulting skepticism is unacceptable the correspondence theory has to be rejected and some other account of truth an epistemic anti realist account of some sort has to be put in its place cf Blanshard This type of objection brings up a host of issues in epistemology the philosophy of mind and general metaphysics All that can be done here is to hint at a few pertinent points cf Searle chap David The objection makes use of the following line of reasoning If truth is correspondence then since knowledge requires truth we have to know that our beliefs correspond to reality if we are to know anything about reality There are two assumptions implicit in this line of reasoning both of them debatable It is assumed that knows only if knows that is true a requirement not underwritten by standard definitions of knowledge which tell us that knows only if is true and is justified in believing The assumption may rest on confusing requirements for knowing with requirements for knowing that one knows ii It is assumed that if truth then knows that is true only if knows that has This is highly implausible By the same standard it would follow that no one who does not know that water is can know that the Nile contains water which would mean of course that until fairly recently nobody knew that the Nile contained water and that until fairly recently nobody knew that there were stars in the sky whales in the sea or that the sun gives light Moreover even if one does know that water is one strategy for finding out whether the liquid in one glass is water does not have to involve chemical analysis one could simply taste it or ask a reliable informant Similarly as far as knowing that is true is concerned the correspondence theory does not entail that we have to know that a belief corresponds to a fact in order to know that it is true or that our method of finding out whether a belief is true has to involve a strategy of actually comparing a belief with a fact although the theory does of course entail that one obtains knowledge only if one obtains a belief that corresponds to a fact More generally one might question whether the objection still has much bite once the metaphors of accessing and comparing are spelled out with more attention to the psychological details of belief formation and to epistemological issues concerning the conditions under which beliefs are justified or warranted For example it is quite unclear how the metaphor of comparing applies to knowledge gained through perceptual belief formation A perceptual belief that may be true and by having acquired that belief one may have come to know that without having compared the content of one belief with anything One might also wonder whether its competitors actually enjoy any significant advantage over the correspondence theory once they are held to the standards set up by this sort of objection For example why should it be easier to find out whether one particular belief coheres with all of one other beliefs than it is to find out whether a belief corresponds with a fact In one form or other the No independent access to reality objection against correspondence theoretic approaches has been one of the if not the main source and motivation for idealist and anti realist stances in philosophy cf Stove However the connection between correspondence theories of truth and the metaphysical realism vs anti realism or idealism debate is less immediate than is often assumed On the one hand deflationists and identity theorists can be and typically are metaphysical realists while rejecting the correspondence theory On the other hand advocates of a correspondence theory can in principle be metaphysical idealists McTaggart or anti realists for one might advocate a correspondence theory while maintaining at the same time a that all facts are constituted by mind or that what facts there are depends somehow on what we believe or are capable of believing or that the correspondence relation between true propositions and facts depends somehow on what we believe or are capable of believing claiming that the correspondence relation between true beliefs or true sentences and facts depends on what we believe can hardly count as a commitment to anti realism Keeping this point in mind one can nevertheless acknowledge that advocacy of a correspondence theory of truth comes much more naturally when combined with a metaphysically realist stance and usually signals commitment to such a stance What is the Language of Thought Hypothesis LOTH is an empirical thesis about the nature of thought and thinking According to LOTH thought and thinking are done in a mental language in a symbolic system physically realized in the brain of the relevant organisms In formulating LOTH philosophers have in mind primarily the variety of thoughts known as propositional attitudes Propositional attitudes are the thoughts described by such sentence forms as believes that hopes that desires that etc where refers to the subject of the attitude is any sentence and that refers to the proposition that is the object of the attitude If we let A stand for such attitude verbs as believe desire hope intend think etc then the propositional attitude statements all have the form As that LOTH can now be formulated more exactly as a hypothesis about the nature of propositional attitudes and the way we entertain them It can be characterized as the conjunction of the following three theses A and Representational Theory of Mind RTM cf Field Fodor Representational Theory of Thought For each propositional attitude A there is a unique and distinct dedicated psychological relation and for all propositions and subjects As that if and only if there is a mental representation such that bears to and means that Representational Theory of Thinking Mental processes thinking in particular consists of causal sequences of tokenings of mental representations Mental representations which as per constitute the direct objects of propositional attitudes belong to a representational or symbolic system which is such that cf Fodor and Pylyshyn representations of the system have a combinatorial syntax and semantics structurally complex molecular representations are systematically built up out of structurally simple atomic constituents and the semantic content of a molecular representation is a function of the semantic content of its atomic constituents together with its syntactic formal structure and the operations on representations constituting as per the domain of mental processes thinking are causally sensitive to the syntactic formal structure of representations defined by this combinatorial syntax Functionalist Materialism Mental representations so characterized are at some suitable level functionally characterizable entities that are possibly multiply realized by the physical properties of the subject having propositional attitudes if the subject is an organism then the realizing properties are presumably the neurophysiological properties of the brain The relation in when RTM is combined with is meant to be understood as a computational functional relation The idea is that each attitude is identified with a characteristic computational functional role played by the mental sentence that is the direct object of that kind of attitude Scare quotes are necessary because it is more appropriate to reserve object for a proposition as we have done above but as long as we keep this in mind it is harmless to use it in this way for LOT sentences For instance what makes a certain mental sentence an occurrent belief might be that it is characteristically the output of perceptual systems and input to an inferential system that interacts decision theoretically with desires to produce further sentences or action commands Or equivalently we may think of belief sentences as those that are accessible only to certain sorts of computational operations appropriate for beliefs but not to others Similarly desire sentences and sentences for other attitudes may be characterized by a different set of operations that define a characteristic computational role for them In the literature it is customary to use the metaphor of a belief box cf Schiffer as a blanket term to cover whatever specific computational role belief sentences turn out to have in the mental economy of their possessors Similarly for desire box etc The Language of Thought Hypothesis is so called because of token mental representations are like sentences in a language in that they have a syntactically and semantically regimented constituent structure Put differently the mental representations that are the direct objects of attitudes are structurally complex symbols whose complexity lends itself to a syntactic and semantic analysis This is also why the LOT is sometimes called Mentalese It is that makes LOTH a species of the so called Computational Theory of Mind CTM This is why LOTH is sometimes called the Computational Representational Theory of Mind or Thought CRTM CRTT cf Rey Indeed LOTH seems to be the most natural product when RTM is combined with a view that treats mental processes or thinking as computational when computation is understood traditionally or classically this is a recent term emphasizing the contrast with connectionist processing which we will discuss later According to LOTH when someone believes that there is a sense in which the immediate object of one belief can be said to be a complex symbol a sentence in one LOT physically realized in the neurophysiology of one brain that has both syntactic structure and a semantic content namely the proposition that So contrary to the orthodox view that takes the belief relation as a dyadic relation between an agent and a proposition LOTH takes it to be a triadic relation among an agent a Mentalese sentence and a proposition The Mentalese sentence can then be said to have the proposition as its semantic intentional content Within the framework of LOTH it is only in this sense can it be said that what is believed is a proposition and thus the proper object of the attitude This triadic view seems to have several advantages over the orthodox dyadic view It is a puzzle in the dyadic view how intentional organisms can stand in direct relation to abstract objects like propositions in such a way as to influence their causal powers According to folk psychology ordinary commonsense psychology that we rely on daily in our dealings with others it is because those states have the propositional content they do that they have the causal powers they do LOTH makes this relatively non mysterious by introducing a physical intermediary that is capable of having the relevant causal powers in virtue of its syntactic structure that encodes its semantic content Another advantage of this is that the thought processes can be causally guided by the syntactic forms of the sentences in a way that respect their semantic contents This is the virtue of to which we ll come back below Mainly because of these features LOTH is said to be poised to scientifically vindicate folk psychology if it turns out to be true Status of LOTH LOTH has primarily been advanced as an empirical thesis although some have argued for the truth of LOTH on a priori or conceptual grounds following the natural conceptual contours of folk psychology see Davies Lycan Rey Jacob Markic argues against Jacob Harman develops and defends LOTH on both empirical and conceptual grounds It is not meant to be taken as an analysis of what the folk mean or for that matter what the scientists ought to mean when they talk about various propositional attitudes and their role in thinking In this regard LOT theorists typically view themselves as engaged in some sort of a proto science or at least in some empirical research program continuous with scientific psychology Indeed as we will see in more detail below when Jerry Fodor first explicitly articulated and elaborated LOTH in some considerable detail in his he basically defended it on the ground that it was assumed by our best scientific theories or models in cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics This empirical status generally accorded to LOTH should be kept firmly in mind when assessing its plausibility and especially its prospects in the light of new evidence and developments in scientific psychology Nevertheless it would be more appropriate to see LOTH more as a foundational thesis rather than as an ongoing research project guided by a set of concrete empirical methods specific theses and principles In this regard LOTH stands to specific scientific theories of the various aspects of the mind somewhat like the Atomic Hypothesis stands to a whole bunch specific scientific theories about the particulate nature of the world some of which may be and certainly historically have been incompatible with each other When viewed this way scientific theories advanced within the LOTH framework are not strictly speaking committed to preserving the folk taxonomy of the mental states in any very exact way Notions like belief desire hope fear etc are folk notions and as such it may not be utterly plausible to expect eliminativist arguments aside that a scientific psychology will preserve the exact contours of these concepts On the contrary there is every reason to believe that scientific counterparts of these notions will carve the mental space somewhat differently For instance it has been noted that the folk notion of belief harbors many distinctions For example it has both a dispositional and an occurrent sense In the occurrent sense it seems to mean something like consciously entertaining and accepting a thought proposition as true There is quite a bit of literature and controversy on the dispositional sense Beliefs are also capable of being explicitly stored in long term memory as opposed to being merely dispositional or tacit Compare for instance I believe that there was a big surprise party for my birthday vs I have always believed that lions don eat their food with forks and knives or that even though until now these latter two thoughts had never occurred to me There is furthermore the issue of degree of belief while I may believe that George will come to dinner with his new girlfriend even though I wouldn bet on it you thinking that you know him better than I do may nevertheless go to the wall for it It is unlikely that there will be one single construct of scientific psychology that will exactly correspond to the folk notion of belief in all these ways For LOTH to vindicate folk psychology it is sufficient that a scientific psychology with a LOT architecture come up with scientifically grounded psychological states that are recognizably like the propositional attitudes of folk psychology and that play more or less similar roles in psychological explanations Scope of LOTH LOTH is an hypothesis about the nature of thought and thinking with propositional content As such it may or may not be applicable to other aspects of mental life Officially it is silent about the nature of some mental phenomena such as experience qualia sensory processes mental images visual and auditory imagination sensory memory perceptual pattern recognition capacities dreaming hallucinating etc To be sure many LOT theorists hold views about these aspects of mental life that sometimes make it seem that they are also to be explained by something similar to LOTH For instance Fodor seems to think that many modular input systems have their own LOT to the extent to which they can be explained in representational and computational terms Indeed many contemporary psychological models treat perceptual input systems in just these terms There is indeed some evidence that this kind of treatment might be appropriate for many perceptual processes But it is to be kept in mind that a system may employ representations and be computational without necessarily satisfying any or both of the clauses in above in any full fledged way Just think of finite automata theory where there are plenty of examples of a computational process defined over states or symbols which lack full blown syntactic and or semantic structural complexity For a useful discussion of varieties of computational processes and their classification see Piccinini Whether sensory or perceptual processes are to be treated within the framework of full blown LOTH is again an open empirical question It might be that the answer to this question is affirmative If so there may be more than one LOT realized in different subsystems or mechanisms in the mind brain So LOTH is not committed to there being a single representational system realized in the brain nor is it committed to the claim that all mental representations are complex or language like nor would it be falsified if it turns out that most aspects of mental life other than the ones involving propositional attitudes don require a LOT Similarly there is strong evidence that the mind also exploits an image like representational medium for certain kinds of mental tasks LOTH is non committal about the existence of an image like representational system for many mental tasks other than the ones involving propositional attitudes But it is committed to the claim that propositional thought and thinking cannot be successfully accounted for in its entirety in purely imagistic terms It claims that a combinatorial sentential syntax is necessary for propositional attitudes and a purely imagistic medium is not adequate for capturing that There are in fact some interesting and difficult issues surrounding these claims The adequacy of an imagistic system seems to turn on the nature of syntax at the sentential level For instance Fodor in Chapter of his book allows that many lexical items in one LOT may be image like he introduces the notion of a mental image picture under description to avoid some obvious inadequacies of pictures what makes a picture a picture of an overweight woman rather than a pregnant one or vice versa etc This is an attempt to combine discursive and imagistic representational elements at the lexical level There may even be a well defined sense in which pictures can be combined to produce structurally complex pictures as in British Empiricism image like simple ideas are combined to produce complex ideas the idea of a unicorn see also Prinz But what is absolutely essential for LOTH and what Fodor insists on is the claim that there is no adequate way in which a purely image like system can capture what is involved in making judgments in judging propositions to be true This seems to require a discursive syntactic approach at the sentential level The general problem here is the inadequacy of pictures or image like representations to express propositions I can judge that the blue box is on top of the red one without judging that the red box is under the blue one I can judge that Mary kisses John without judging that John kisses Mary and so on for indefinitely many such cases It is hard to see how images or pictures can do that without using any syntactic structure or discursive elements to say nothing of judging conditionals disjunctive or negative propositions quantifications negative existentials etc Moreover there are difficulties with imagistic representations arising from demands on processing representations As we will see below turns out to provide the foundations for one of the most important arguments for LOTH it makes it possible to mechanize thinking understood as a semantically coherent thought process which as per consists of a causal sequence of tokenings of mental representations It is not clear however how an equivalent of could be provided for images or pictures in order to accommodate operations defined over them even if something like an equivalent of could be given On the other hand there are truly promising attempts to integrate discursive symbolic theorem proving with reasoning with image like symbols They achieve impressive efficiency in theorem proving or in any deductive process defined over the expressions of such an integrated system Such attempts if they prove to be generalizable to psychological theorizing are by no means threats to LOTH on the contrary such systems have every feature to make them a species of a LOT system they satisfy Nativism and LOTH In the book in which Fodor introduced the LOTH he also argued that all concepts are innate As a result the connection between LOTH and an implausibly strong version of conceptual nativism looked very much internal This historical coincidence has led some people to think that LOTH is essentially committed to a very strong form of nativism so strong in fact that it seems to make a reductio of itself see for instance Churchland Putnam A Clark The gist of his argument was that since learning concepts is a form of hypothesis formation and confirmation it requires a system of mental representations in which formation and confirmation of hypotheses are to be carried out but then there is a non trivial sense in which one already has albeit potentially the resources to express the extension of the concepts to be learned In his LOT Fodor continues to claim that concepts cannot be learned and that the very idea of concept learning is confused Now according to HF the Hypothesis Formation and Confirmation model the process by which one learns must include the inductive evaluation of some such hypothesis as The things are the ones that are green or triangular But the inductive evaluation of that hypothesis itself requires inter alia bringing the property green or triangular before the mind as such Quite generally you can represent anything as such and such unless you already have the concept such and such All that being so it follows on pain of circularity that concept learning as HF understands it can be a way of acquiring concept Conclusion If concept learning is as HF understands it there can be no such thing This conclusion is entirely general it doesn matter whether the target concept is primitive like GREEN or complex like GREEN OR TRIANGULAR LOT Note that this argument and the predecessors Fodor articulated in his previous writings and especially in his are entirely general applicable to any hypothesis that identifies concepts with mental representations whether or not these representations belong to a LOT The crux of the issue seems to be that learning concepts is a rational process There seem to be non arbitrary semantic and epistemic liaisons between the target concept to be acquired and its evidence base This evidence base needs to be represented and rationally tied to the target concept This target concept needs also to be expressed in terms of representations one already possesses Fodor thinks that any model of concept learning understood in this sense will have to be a form of hypothesis formation and confirmation But not every form of concept acquisition is learning There are non rational ways of acquiring concepts whose explanation need not be at the cognitive level brute triggering mechanisms that can be activated in sorts of ways that can presumably be explained at the sub cognitive or neurophysiological levels If concepts cannot be learned then they are either innate or non rationally acquired Whereas early Fodor used to think that concepts must therefore be innate maybe he thought that non learning concept acquisition forms are limited to sensory or certain classes of perceptual concepts he now thinks that they may be acquired but the explanation of this is not the business of cognitive psychology Whatever one may think of the merits of Fodor arguments for concept nativism or of his recent anti learning stance it should be emphasized that LOTH per se has very little to do with it LOTH is not committed to such a strong version of nativism especially about concepts It also need not be committed to any anti learning stance about concepts It is certainly plausible to assume that LOTH will turn out to have some empirically as well as theoretically a priori motivated nativist commitments about the structural organization and dynamic management of the entire representational system But this much is to be expected especially in the light of recent empirical findings and trends This however does not constitutes a reductio It is an open empirical question how much nativism is true about concepts and LOTH should be so taken as to be capable of accommodating whatever turns out to be true in this matter LOTH therefore when properly conceived is independent of any specific proposal about conceptual nativism Naturalism and LOTH One of the most attractive features of LOTH is that it is a central component of an ongoing research program in philosophy of psychology to naturalize the mind that is to give a theoretical framework in which the mind could naturally be seen as part of the physical world without postulating irreducibly psychic entities events processes or properties Fodor historically the most important defender of LOTH once identified the major mysteries in philosophy of mind thus How could anything material have conscious states How could anything material have semantical properties How could anything material be rational where this means something like how could the state transitions of a physical system preserve semantical properties Reply to Devitt LOTH is a full blown attempt to give a naturalist answer to the third question an attempt to solve at least part of the problem underlying the second one and is almost completely silent about the first According to RTM propositional attitudes are relations to meaningful mental representations whose causally sequenced tokenings constitute the process of thinking This much can in principle be granted by an intentional realist who might nevertheless reject LOTH Indeed there are plenty of theorists who accept RTM in some suitable form and also happily accept in many cases but reject LOTH either by explicitly rejecting or simply by remaining neutral about it Among some of the prominent philosophers who choose the former option are Searle Stalnaker Lewis Barwise and Perry Some who want to remain neutral include Loar Dretske Armstrong and many contemporary functionalists including some connectionists But RTM per se doesn so much propose a naturalistic solution to intentionality and mechanization of thinking as simply assert a framework to emphasize intentional realism and perhaps with a declaration of a commitment to naturalism or physicalism at best How then is the addition of supposed to help Let us first try to see in a bit more detail what the problem is supposed to be in the first place to which is proposed as a solution Let us start by reflecting on thinking and see what it is about thinking that makes it a mystery in Fodor list This will give rise to one of the most powerful albeit still nondemonstrative arguments for LOTH RTM second clause in effect says that thinking is at least the tokenings of states that are a intentional have representational propositional content and causally connected But surely thinking is more There could be a causally connected series of intentional states that makes no sense at all Thinking therefore is causally proceeding from states to states that makes semantic sense the transitions among states must preserve some of their semantic properties to count as thinking In the ideal case this property would be the truth value of the states But in most cases any interesting intentional or epistemic property would do warrantedness degree of confirmation semantic coherence given a certain practical context like satisfaction of goals in a specific context etc In general it is hard to spell out what this requirement of making sense comes to The intuitive idea however should be clear Thinking is not proceeding from thoughts to thoughts in arbitrary fashion thoughts that are causally connected are in some fashion semantically rationally epistemically connected too If this were not so there would be little point in thinking thinking couldn serve any useful purpose Call this general phenomenon then the semantic coherence of causally connected thought processes LOTH is offered as a solution to this puzzle how is thinking conceived this way physically possible This is the problem of thinking thus the problem of mechanization of rationality in Fodor version How does LOTH propose to solve this problem and bring us one big step closer to the naturalization of the mind Syntactic Engine Driving a Semantic Engine Computation The two most important achievements of century that are at the foundations of LOTH as well as most of modern Artificial Intelligence AI research and most of the so called information processing approaches to cognition are the developments in modern symbolic formal logic and ii Alan Turing idea of a Turing Machine and Turing computability It is putting these two ideas together that gives LOTH its enormous explanatory power within a naturalistic framework Modern logic showed that most of deductive reasoning can be formalized most semantic relations among symbols can be entirely captured by the symbols formal syntactic properties and the relations among them And Turing showed roughly that if a process has a formally specifiable character then it can be mechanized So we can appreciate the implications of and ii for the philosophy of psychology in this way if thinking consists in processing representations physically realized in the brain in the way the internal data structures are realized in a computer and these representations form a formal system a language with its proper combinatorial syntax and semantics and a set of derivations rules formally defined over the syntactic features of those representations allowing for specific but powerful programs to be written in terms of them then the problem of thinking as described above can in principle be solved in completely naturalistic terms thus the mystery surrounding how a physical device can ever have semantically coherent state transitions processes can be removed Thus given the commitment to naturalism the hypothesis that the brain is a kind of computer trafficking in representations in virtue of their syntactic properties is the basic idea of LOTH and the AI vision of cognition Computers are environments in which symbols are manipulated in virtue of their formal features but what is thus preserved are their semantic properties hence the semantic coherence of symbolic processes Slightly paraphrasing Haugeland cf who puts the same point nicely in the form of a motto The Formalist Motto If you take care of the syntax of a representational system its semantics will take care of itself This is in virtue of the mimicry or mirroring relation between the semantic and formal properties of symbols As Dennett once put it in describing LOTH we can view the thinking brain as a syntactically driven engine preserving semantic properties of its processes driving a semantic engine What is so nice about this picture is that if LOTH is true we have a naturalistically adequate causal treatment of thinking that respects the semantic properties of the thoughts involved it is in virtue of the physically coded syntactic formal features that thoughts cause each other while the coherence of their semantic properties is preserved precisely in virtue of this Whether or not LOTH actually turns out to be empirically true in the details or in its entire vision of rational thinking this picture of a syntactic engine driving a semantic one can at least be taken to be an important philosophical demonstration of how Descartes challenge can be met cf Rey chp Descartes claimed that rationality in the sense of having the power to act in all the contingencies of life in the way in which our reason makes us act cannot possibly be possessed by a purely physical device The rational soul could not be in any way extracted from the power of matter but must be expressly created Descartes was completely puzzled by just this rational character and semantic coherence of thought processes so much so that he failed to even imagine a possible mechanistic explication of it He thus was forced to appeal to Divine creation But we can now see imagine at least a possible mechanistic naturalistic scenario Intentionality and LOTH But where do the semantic properties of the mental representations come from in the first place How can they mean anything This is Brentano challenge to a naturalist Brentano bafflement was with the intentionality of the human mind its apparently mysterious power to represent things events properties in the world He thought that nothing physical can have this property The reference to something as an object is a distinguishing characteristic of all mental phenomena No physical phenomenon exhibits anything similar Brentano This problem of intentionality is the second problem or mystery in Fodor list quoted above I said that LOTH officially offers only a partial solution to it and perhaps proposes a framework within which the remainder of the solution can be couched and elaborated in a naturalistically acceptable way Recall that RTM contains a clause that says that the immediate object of a propositional attitude that is a mental representation that means that Again attributes a compositional semantics to the syntactically complex symbols belonging to one LOT that are as per realized by the physical properties of a thinking system According to LOTH the semantic content of propositional attitudes is inherited from the semantic content of the mental symbols So Brentano questions for a LOT theorist becomes how do the symbols in one LOT get their meanings in the first place There are two levels or stages at which this question can be raised and answered At the level of atomic symbols non logical primitives how do the atomic symbols represent what they do At the level of molecular symbols phrasal complexes or sentences how do molecular symbols represent what they do There have been at least two major lines LOT theorists have taken regarding these questions The one that is least committal might perhaps be usefully described as the official position regarding LOTH treatment of intentionality Most LOT theorists seem to have taken this line The official line doesn propose any theory about the first stage but simply assumes that the first question can be answered in a naturalistically acceptable way In other words officially LOTH simply assumes that the atomic symbols expressions in one LOT have whatever meanings they have But the official line continues LOTH has a lot to say about the second stage the stage where the semantic contents are computed or assigned to complex molecular symbols on the basis of their combinatorial syntax or grammar together with whatever meanings atomic symbols are assumed to have in the first stage This procedure is familiar from a Tarski style definition of truth conditions of sentences The truth value of complex sentences in propositional logic are completely determined by the truth values of the atomic sentences they contain together with the rules fixed by the truth tables of the connectives occurring in the complex sentences Example and is true just in case both and are true but false otherwise This process is similar but more complex in first order languages and even more so for natural languages in fact we don have a completely working compositional semantics for the latter at the moment So if we have a semantic interpretation of atomic symbols if we have symbols whose reference and extension are fixed at the first stage by whatever naturalistic mechanism turns out to govern it then the combinatorial syntax will take over and effectively determine the semantic interpretation truth conditions of the complex sentences they are constituents of So officially LOTH would only contribute to a complete naturalization project if there is a naturalistic story at the atomic level Early Fodor for instance envisaged a science of psychology which among other things would reasonably set for itself the goal of discovering the combinatorial syntactic principles of LOT and the computational rules governing its operations without worrying much about semantic matters especially about how to fix the semantics of atomic symbols he probably thought that this was not a job for LOTH Similarly Field is very explicit about the combinatorial rules for assigning truth conditions to the sentences of the internal code In fact Field major argument for LOTH is that given a naturalistic causal theory of reference for atomic symbols about which he is optimistic Field it is the only naturalistic theory that has a chance of solving Brentano puzzle For the moment this is not much more than a hope but according to the LOT theorist it is a well founded hope based on a number of theoretical and empirical assumptions and data Furthermore it is a framework defining a naturalistic research program in which there have been promising successes As I said this official and in a way least committal line has been the more standard way of conceiving LOTH role in the project of naturalizing intentionality But some have gone beyond it and explored the ways in which the resources of LOTH can be exploited even in answering the first question about the semantics of atomic symbols Now there is a weak version of an answer to on the part of LOTH and a strong version On the weak version LOTH may be untendentiously viewed as inevitably providing some of the resources in giving the ultimate naturalistic theory in naturalizing the meaning of atomic symbols The basic idea is that whatever the ultimate naturalistic theory turns out to be true about atomic expressions computation as conceived by LOTH will be part of it For instance it may be that as with nomic covariation theories of meaning Fodor Dretske the meaning of an atomic predicate may consist in its potential to get tokened in the presence of or in causal response to something that instantiates the property the predicate is said to express A natural way of explicating this potential may partly but ultimately rely on certain computational principles the symbol may be subjected to within a LOT framework or principles that in some sense govern the behavior of the symbol Insofar as computation is naturalistically understood in the way LOTH proposes a complete answer to the first question about the semantics of atomic symbols may plausibly involve an explicatory appeal to computation within a system of symbols This is the weak version because it doesn see LOTH as proposing a complete solution to the first question above but only helping it A strong version would have it that LOTH provides a complete naturalistic solution to both questions given the resources of LOTH we don need to look any further to meet Brentano challenge The basic idea lies in so called functional or conceptual role semantics according to which a concept is the concept it is precisely in virtue of the particular causal functional potential it has in interacting with other concepts Each concept may be thought of as having a certain distinctive set of epistemic semantic relations or liaisons to other concepts We can conceive of this set as determining a certain conceptual role for each concept We can then take these roles to determine the semantic identity of concepts concepts are the concepts they are because they have the conceptual roles they have that is to say among other things concepts represent whatever they do precisely in virtue of these roles The idea then is to reduce each conceptual role to causal functional role of atomic symbols now conceived as primitive terms in LOTH and then use the resources of LOTH to reduce it in turn to computational role Since computation is naturalistically well defined the argument goes and since causal interactions between thoughts and concepts can be understood completely in terms of computation we can completely naturalize intentionality if we can successfully treat meanings as arising out of thoughts concepts internal interactions with each other In other words the strong version of LOTH would claim that atomic symbols in LOT have the content they do in virtue of their potential for causal interactions with other tokens and cashing out this potential in mechanical naturalistic terms is what among other things LOTH is for LOTH then comes as a naturalistic rescuer for conceptual role semantics It is not clear whether any one holds this strong version of LOTH in this rather naive form But certainly some people have elaborated the basic idea in quite subtle ways for which Cummins chp is perhaps the best example But also see Block and Field But even in the best hands the proposal turns out to be very problematic and full of difficulties nobody seems to know how to straighten out In fact some of the most ardent critics of taking LOTH as incorporating a functional role semantics turn out to be some of the most ardent defenders of LOTH understood in a weak non committal sense we have explored above see Fodor chp Fodor and Lepore Fodor attack on AI way of doing procedural semantics is also relevant here Haugeland Searle and Putnam quite explicitly take LOTH to involve a program for providing a complete semantic account of mental symbols which they then attack accordingly It is also possible in fact quite natural to combine conceptual role semantics internalist with causal informational psychosemantics externalist The result is sometimes known as two factor theories If this turns out to be the right way to naturalize intentionality then given what is said above about the potential resources of LOTH in contributing to both factors it is easy to see why many theorists who worry about naturalizing intentionality are attracted to LOTH As indicated previously LOTH is almost completely silent about consciousness and the problem of qualia the third mystery in Fodor list in the quote above But the naturalist hope is that this problem too will be solved if not by LOTH then by something else On the other hand it is important to emphasize that LOTH is neutral about the naturalizability of consciousness qualia If it turns out that qualia cannot be naturalized this would by no means show that LOTH is false or defective in some way In fact there are people who seem to think that LOTH may well turn out to be true even though qualia can perhaps not be naturalized Block Chalmers McGinn Finally it should be emphasized that LOTH has no particular commitment to every symbolic activity being conscious Conscious thoughts and thinking may be the tip of a computational iceberg Nevertheless there are ways in which LOTH can be helpful for an account of state consciousness that seeks to explain a thought being conscious in terms of a higher order thought which is about the first order thought So to the extent to which thought and thinking are conscious to that extent LOTH can perhaps be viewed as providing some of the necessary resources for a naturalistic account of state consciousness for elaboration see Rosenthal and Lycan Arguments for LOTH We have already seen two major arguments perhaps historically the most important ones for LOTH First we have noted that if LOTH is true then all the essential features of the common sense conception of propositional attitudes will be explicated in a naturalistic framework which is likely to be co opted by scientific cognitive psychology thus vindicating folk psychology Second we have discussed that if true LOTH would solve one of the mysteries about thinking minds how is thinking as characterized above possible How is rationality mechanically possible Then we have also seen a third argument that LOTH would partially contribute to the project of naturalizing intentionality by offering an account of how the semantic properties of whole attitudes are fixed on the basis of their atomic constituents But there have been many other arguments for LOTH In this section I will describe only those arguments that have been historically more influential and controversial When Fodor first formulated LOTH with significant elaboration in his he introduced his major argument for it along with its initial formulation in the first chapter It was basically this our best scientific theories and models of different aspects of higher cognition assume a framework that requires a computational representational medium for them to be true More specifically he analyzed the basic form of the information processing models developed to account for three types of cognitive phenomena perception as the fixation of perceptual beliefs concept learning as hypothesis formation and confirmation and decision making as a form of representing and evaluating the consequences of possible actions carried out in a situation with a preordered set of preferences He rightly pointed out that all these psychological models treated mental processes as computational processes defined over representations Then he drew what seems to be the obvious conclusion if these models are right in at least treating mental processes as computational even if not in detail then there must be a LOT over which they are defined hence LOTH In Fodor the arguments for different aspects of LOTH are diffused and the emphasis with the book slogan no computation without representation is put on the RTM rather than on or But all the elements are surely there People seem to be capable of entertaining an infinite number of thoughts at least in principle although they in fact entertain only a finite number of them Indeed adults who speak a natural language are capable of understanding sentences they have never heard uttered before Here is one there is a big lake of melted gold on the dark side of the moon I bet that you have never heard this sentence before and yet you have no difficulty in understanding it it is one you in fact likely believe false But this sentence was arbitrary there are infinitely many such sentences I can in principle utter and you can in principle understand But understanding a sentence is to entertain the thought proposition it expresses So there are in principle infinitely many thoughts you are capable of entertaining This is sometimes expressed by saying that we have an unbounded competence in entertaining different thoughts even though we have a bounded performance But this unbounded capacity is to be achieved by finite means For instance storing an infinite number of representations in our heads is out of the question we are finite beings If human cognitive capacities capacities to entertain an unbounded number of thoughts or to have attitudes towards an unbounded number of propositions are productive in this sense how is this to be explained on the basis of finitary resources The explanation LOTH offers is straightforward postulate a representational system that satisfies at least Indeed recursion is the only known way to produce an infinite number of symbols from a finite base In fact given LOTH productivity of thought as a competence mechanism seems to be guaranteed Systematicity of thought consists in the empirical fact that the ability to entertain certain thoughts is intrinsically connected to the ability to entertain certain others Which ones Thoughts that are related in a certain way In what way There is a certain initial difficulty in answering such questions I think partly because of this Fodor and Fodor and Pylyshyn who are the original defenders of this kind of argument first argue for the systematicity of language production and understanding the ability to produce understand certain sentences is intrinsically connected to the ability to produce understand certain others Given that a mature speaker is able to produce understand a certain sentence in her native language by psychological law there always appear to be a cluster of other sentences that she is able to produce understand For instance we don find speakers who know how to express in their native language the fact that John loves the girl but not the fact that the girl loves John This is apparently so moreover for expressions of any place relation Fodor and Pylyshyn bring out the force of this psychological fact by comparing learning languages the way we actually do with learning a language by memorizing a huge phrase book In the phrase book model there is nothing to prevent someone learning how to say John loves the girl without learning how to say the girl loves John In fact that is exactly the way some information booklets prepared for tourists help them to cope with their new social environment You might for example learn from a phrase book how to say I like to have a cup of coffee with sugar and milk in Turkish without knowing how to say understand absolutely anything else in Turkish In other words the phrase book model of learning a language allows arbitrarily punctate linguistic capabilities In contrast a speaker knowledge of her native language is not punctate it is systematic Accordingly we do not find by nomological necessity native speakers whose linguistic capacities are punctate Now how is this empirical truth in fact a law like generalization to be explained Obviously if this is a general nomological fact then learning one native language cannot be modeled on the phrase book model What is the alternative The alternative is well known Native speakers master the grammar and vocabulary of their language But this is just to say that sentences are not atomic but have syntactic constituent structure If you have a vocabulary the grammar tells you how to combine systematically the words into sentences Hence in this way if you know how to construct a particular sentence out of certain words you automatically know how to construct many others If you view all sentences as atomic then as Fodor and Pylyshyn say the systematicity of language production understanding is a mystery but if you acknowledge that sentences have syntactic constituent structure systematicity of linguistic capacities is what you automatically get it is guaranteed This is the orthodox explanation of linguistic systematicity From here according to Fodor and Pylyshyn establishing the systematicity of thought as a nomological fact is one step away If it is a law that the ability to understand a sentence is systematically connected to the ability to understand many others then it is similarly a law that the ability to think a thought is systematically connected to the ability to think many others For to understand a sentence is just to think the thought proposition it expresses Since according to RTM to think a certain thought is just to token a representation in the head that expresses the relevant proposition the ability to token certain representations is systematically connected to the ability to token certain others But then this fact needs an adequate explanation too The classical explanation LOTH offers is to postulate a system of representations with combinatorial syntax exactly as in the case of the explanation of the linguistic systematicity This is what offers This seems to be the only explanation that does not make the systematicity of thought a miracle and thus argues for the LOT hypothesis However thought is not only systematic but also compositional systematically connected thoughts are also always semantically related in such a way that the thoughts so related seem to be composed out of the same semantic elements For instance the ability to think John loves the girl is connected to the ability to think the girl loves John but not to say protons are made up of quarks or to Why is this so The answer LOTH gives is to postulate a combinatorial semantics in addition to a combinatorial syntax where an atomic constituent of a mental sentence makes approximately the same semantic contribution to any complex mental expression in which it occurs This is what Fodor and Pylyshyn call the principle of compositionality In brief it is an argument for LOTH that it offers a cogent and principled solution to the systematicity and compositionality of cognitive capacities by postulating a system of representations that has a combinatorial syntax and semantics a system of representations that satisfies at least Argument from the Systematicity of Thinking Inferential Coherence Systematicity of thought does not seem to be restricted solely to the systematic ability to entertain certain thoughts If the system of mental representations does have a combinatorial syntax then there is a set of rules psychosyntactic formation rules so to speak that govern the construction of well formed expressions in the system It is this fact that guarantees that if you can form a mental sentence on the basis of certain rules then you can also form many others on the basis of the same rules The rules of combinatorial syntax determine the syntactic or formal structure of complex mental representations This is the formative or formational aspect of systematicity But inferential thought processes thinking seem to be systematic too the ability to make certain inferences is intrinsically connected to the ability to make certain many others For instance you do not find minds that can infer A from A but cannot infer from A It seems to be a psychological fact that inferential capacities come in clusters that are homogeneous in certain aspects How is this fact the inferential or transformational systematicity to be explained As we have seen the explanation LOTH offers depends on the exploitation of the notion of logical form or syntactic structure determined by the combinatorial syntax postulated for the representational system The combinatorial syntax not only gives us a criterion of well formedness for mental expressions but it also defines the logical form or syntactic structure for each well formed expression The classical solution to inferential systematicity is to make the mental operations on representations sensitive to their form or structure to insist on Since from a syntactic view point similarly formed expressions will have similar forms it is possible to define a single operation which will apply to only certain expressions that have a certain form say only to conjunctions or conditionals This allows the LOT theorist to give homogeneous explanations of what appear to be homogeneous classes of inferential capacities This is one of the greatest virtues of LOTH hence provides an argument for it The solution LOTH offers for what I called the problem of thinking above is connected to the argument here because the two phenomena are connected in a deep way Thinking requires that the logico semantic properties of a particular thought process be somehow causally implicated in the process say inferring that John is happy from knowing that if John is at the beach then John is happy and coming to realize that John is indeed at the beach The systematicity of inferential thought processes then is based on the observation that if the agent is capable of making that particular inference then she is capable of making many other somehow similarly organized inferences But the idea of similar organization in this context seems to demand some sort of classification of thoughts independently of their particular content But what can the basis of such a classification be The only basis seems to be the logico syntactic properties of thoughts their form Although it feels a little uneasy to talk about syntactic properties of thoughts common sensically understood it seems that they are forced upon us by the very attempt to understand their semantic properties how for instance could we explain the semantic content of the thought that if John is at the beach then he is happy without somehow appealing to its being a conditional This is the point of contact between the two phenomena Especially when the demands of naturalism are added to this picture inferring a LOT a representational system satisfying realized in the brain becomes almost irresistible Indeed Rey doesn resist and claims that given the above observations LOTH can be established on the basis of arguments that are not merely empirical I leave it to the reader to evaluate whether mere critical reflection on our concepts of thought and thinking along with certain mundane empirical observations about them can be sufficient to establish LOTH Objections to LOTH There have been numerous arguments against LOTH Some of them are directed more specifically against the Representational Theory of Mind A some against functionalist materialism Here I will concentrate only on those arguments specifically targeting the most controversial component of LOTH These arguments rely on the explanations offered by LOTH defenders for certain aspects of natural languages In particular many LOT theorists advert to LOTH to explain how natural languages are learned how natural languages are understood or how the utterances in such languages can be meaningful For instance according to Fodor natural languages are learned by forming and confirming hypotheses about the translation of natural language sentences into Mentalese such as Snow is white is true in English if and only if where is a sentence in one LOT But to be able to do that one needs a representational medium in which to form and confirm hypotheses at least to represent the truth conditions of natural language sentences The LOT is such a medium Again natural languages are understood because roughly such an understanding consists in translating their sentences into one Mentalese Similarly natural language utterances are meaningful in virtue of the meanings of corresponding Mentalese sentences The basic complaint is that in each of these cases either the explanations generate a regress because the same sort of explanations ought to be given for how the LOT is learned understood or can be meaningful or else they are gratuitous because if a successful explanation can be given for LOT that does not generate a regress then it could and ought to be given for the natural language phenomena without introducing a LOT see Blackburn Fodor response in is that LOT is not learned it innate that it understood in a different sense than the sense involved in natural language comprehension that LOT sentences acquire their meanings not in virtue of another meaningful language but in a completely different way perhaps by standing in some sort of causal relation to what they represent or by having certain computational profiles see above For many who have a Wittgensteinian bent these replies are not likely to be convincing But here the issues tend to concern RTM rather than Laurence and Margolis point out that the regress arguments depend on the assumption that LOTH is introduced only to explain If it can be shown that there are lots of other empirical phenomena for which the LOTH provides good explanations then the regress arguments fail because LOTH then would not be gratuitous In fact as we have seen above there are plenty of such phenomena But still it is important to realize that the sort of explanations proposed for the understanding of one LOT computational use activity of LOT sentences with certain meanings and how LOT sentences can be meaningful computational roles and or nomic relations with the world cannot be given for it unclear for example what it would be like to give a computational role and or nomic relation account for the meanings of natural language utterances See Knowles for a reply to Laurence Margolis Margolis Laurence counterreplies to Knowles Dennett in his review of Fodor has raised the following objection cf Fodor for a similar discussion In a recent conversation with the designer of a chess playing program I heard the following criticism of a rival program it thinks it should get its queen out early This ascribes a propositional attitude to the program in a very useful and predictive way for as the designer went on to say one can usefully count on chasing that queen around the board But for all the many levels of explicit representation to be found in that program nowhere is anything roughly synonymous with I should get my queen out early explicitly tokened The level of analysis to which the designer remark belongs describes features of the program that are in an entirely innocent way emergent properties of the computational processes that have engineering reality I see no reason to believe that the relation between belief talk and psychological talk will be any more direct Dennett The objection as Fodor points out isn that the program has a dispositional or potential belief that it will get its queen out early Rather the program actually operates on this belief There appear to be lots of other examples in reasoning we pretty often follow certain inference rules like modus ponens disjunctive syllogism etc without necessarily explicitly representing them The standard reply to such objections is to draw a distinction between rules on the basis of which Mentalese data structures are manipulated and the data structures themselves intuitively the program data distinction LOTH is not committed to every rule being explicitly represented In fact as a point of nomological fact in a computational device not every rule can be explicitly represented some have to be hard wired and thus implicit in this sense In other words LOTH permits but doesn require that rules be explicitly represented On the other hand data structures have to be explicitly represented it is these that are manipulated formally by the rules No causal manipulation is possible without explicit tokening of these structures According to Fodor if a propositional attitude is an actual episode in one reasoning that plays a causal role then LOTH is committed to explicit representation of its content which is as per and causally implicated in the physical process realizing that reasoning Dispositional propositional attitudes can then be accounted for in terms of an appropriate principle of inferential closure of explicitly represented propositional attitudes cf Lycan Dennett chess program certainly involves explicit representations of the chess board the pieces etc and perhaps some of the rules Which rules are implicit and which are explicit depend on the empirical details of the program Pointing to the fact that there may be some rules that are emergent out of the implementation of explicit rules and data structures does not suffice to undermine LOTH In any sufficiently complex computational system there are bound to be many symbol manipulations with no obviously corresponding description at the level of propositional attitudes For instance when a multiplication program is run through a standard conventional computer the steps of the program are translated into the computer machine language and executed there but at this level the operations apply to and with no obvious way to map them onto the original numbers to be multiplied or to the multiplication operation So it seems that at those levels that according to Dennett have engineering reality there are plenty of explicit tokenings of symbols with appropriate operations over them that don correspond to anything like the propositional attitudes of folk psychology In other words there is plenty of symbolic activity which it would be wrong to say a person engages in Rather they are done by the person subpersonal computational components as opposed to the person How to rule out such cases cf Fodor for a similar discussion They are ruled out by an appropriate reading of and says that the person herself must stand in an appropriate computational relation to a Mentalese sentence which as per has a suitable syntax and semantics Only then will the sentence constitute the person having a propositional attitude Not all explicit symbols in one LOT will satisfy this In other words not every computational routine will correspond to a processing appropriately described as storage in the belief box Furthermore as pointed out by Fodor LOTH would vindicate the common sense view of propositional attitudes if they turn out to be computational relations to Mentalese sentences It may not be further required that every explicit representation correspond to a propositional attitude There have been many other objections to LOTH in recent years raised especially by connectionists that LOT systems cannot handle certain cognitive tasks like perceptual pattern recognition that they are too brittle and not sufficiently damage resistant that they don exhibit graceful degradation when physically damaged or as a response to noisy or degraded input that they are too rigid deterministic so are not well suited for modeling humans capacity to satisfy multiple soft constraints so gracefully that they are not biologically realistic and so on For useful discussions of these and many similar objections see Rumelhart McClelland and the PDP Research Group Fodor and Pylyshyn Horgan and Tienson Horgan McLaughlin and Warfield Bechtel and Abrahamsen Marcus The Connectionism Classicism Debate When Jerry Fodor published his influential book The Language of Thought in he called LOTH the only game in town As we have seen it was the philosophical articulation of the assumptions that underlay the new developments in cognitive sciences after the demise of behaviorism Fodor argued for the truth of LOTH on the basis of the successes of the best scientific theories we had then Indeed most of the scientific work in cognitive psychology psycholinguistics and AI assumed the framework of LOTH In the early however Fodor claim that LOTH was the only game in town was beginning to be challenged by some who were working on so called connectionist networks They claimed that connectionism offered a new and radically different alternative to classicism in modeling cognitive phenomena The name classicism has since then become to be applied to the LOTH framework On the other hand many classicists like Fodor thought that connectionism was nothing but a slightly more sophisticated way with which the old and long dead associationism whose roots could be traced back to early British empiricists was being revived In Fodor and Pylyshyn published a long article Connectionism and Cognitive Architecture A Critical Analysis in which they launched a formidable attack on connectionism which largely set the terms for the ensuing debate between connectionists and classicists forceful criticism consists in posing a dilemma for connectionists They either fail to explain the law like cognitive regularities like systematicity and productivity in an adequate way or the connectionist models are nothing but mere implementation models of classical architectures hence they fail to provide a radically new paradigm as connectionists claim This conclusion was also meant to be a challenge Explain the cognitive regularities in question without postulating a LOT architecture First let me present argument against connectionism in a somewhat reconstructed fashion It will be helpful to characterize the debate by locating the issues according to the reactions many connectionists had to the premises of the argument Argument against Connectionism in their article Cognition essentially involves representational states and causal operations whose domain and range are these states consequently any scientifically adequate account of cognition should acknowledge such states and processes Higher cognition specifically thought and thinking with propositional content conceived in this way has certain empirically interesting properties in particular it is a law of nature that cognitive capacities are productive systematic and inferentially coherent Accordingly the architecture of any proposed cognitive model is scientifically adequate only if it guarantees that cognitive capacities are productive systematic etc This would amount to explaining in the scientifically relevant and required sense how it could be a law that cognition has these properties The only way necessary condition for a cognitive architecture to guarantee systematicity etc is for it to involve a representational system for which is true see above Classical architectures necessarily satisfy Either the architecture of connectionist models does satisfy or it does not If it does then connectionist models are implementations of the classical LOT architecture and have little new to offer they fail to compete with classicism and thus connectionism does not constitute a radically new way of modeling cognition If it does not then since connectionism does not then guarantee systematicity etc in the required sense connectionism is empirically false as a theory of the cognitive architecture Therefore connectionism is either true as an implementation theory or empirically false as a theory of cognitive architecture The notion of cognitive architecture assumes special importance in this debate characterization of the notion goes as follows The architecture of the cognitive system consists of the set of basic operations resources functions principles etc generally the sorts of properties that would be described in a user manual for that architecture if it were available on a computer whose domain and range are the representational states of the organism Also note that and are meta architectural properties in that they are themselves conditions upon any specific architecture being classical They define classicism per se but not any particular way of being classical Classicism as such simply claims that whatever the particular cognitive architecture of the brain might turn out to be whatever the specific grammar of Mentalese turns out to be must be true of it claim that this is the only way an architecture can be said to guarantee the nomological necessity of cognitive regularities like systematicity etc This seems to be the relevant and required sense in which a scientific explanation of cognition is required to guarantee the regularities hence the third premise in their argument Connectionist responses have fallen into four classes Deny premise The rejection of commits connectionists to what is sometimes called radical or eliminativist connectionism Premise as point out draws a general line between eliminativism and representationalism or intentional realism There has been some controversy as to whether connectionism constitutes a serious challenge to the fundamental tenets of folk psychology Although it may still be too early for assessment the connectionist research program has been overwhelmingly cognitivist most connectionists do in fact advance their models as having causally efficacious representational states and explicitly endorse first premise So they seem to accept intentional realism Accept the conclusion This group may be seen as more or less accepting the cogency of the entire argument and characterizes itself as implementationalist they hold that connectionist networks will implement a classical architecture or language of thought According to this group the appropriate niche for neural networks is closer to neuroscience than to cognitive psychology They seem to view the importance of the program in terms of its prospects of closing the gap between the neurosciences and high level cognitive theorizing In this many seem content to admit premise vi See Marcus for a discussion of the virtues of placing connectionist models closer to implementational level Deny premise ii or iv Some connectionists reject ii or iv holding that there are no lawlike cognitive regularities such as systematicity etc to be explained or that such regularities do not require a like architecture for their explanation Those who question ii often question the empirical evidence for systematicity etc and tend to ignore the challenge put forward by Those who question iv also often question ii or they argue that there can be very different sort of explanations for systematicity and the like evolutionary explanations see Braddon Mitchell and Fitzpatrick or they question the very notion of explanation involved Matthews There are indeed quite a number of different kinds of arguments in the literature against these premises For a sampling see Aydede and McLaughlin who partitions the debate similarly Deny premise vi The group of connectionists who have taken challenge most seriously has tended to reject premise vi in their argument while accepting on the face of it the previous five premises sometimes with reservations on the issue of productivity They think that it is possible for connectionist representations to be syntactically structured in some sense without being classical Prominent in this group are Smolensky van Gelder Chalmers Some connectionists whose models give support to this line include Elman Hinton Touretzky Pollack Barnden and Srinivas Shastri and Ajjanagadde Plate Hummel et al Van Der Velde and De Kamps Barrett et al Sanjeevi and Bhattacharyya Much of the recent debate between connectionists and classicists has focused on this option How is it possible to reject premise vi which seems true by definition of classicism The connectionists answer roughly put is that when you devise a representational system whose satisfaction of relies on a non concatenative realization of structural syntactic complexity of representations you have a non classical system See especially Smolensky and van Gelder Interestingly some classicists like Fodor and McLaughlin seem to agree stipulate that you have a classical system only if the syntactic complexity of representations is realized concatenatively or as it is sometimes put explicitly We stipulate that for a pair of expression types the first is a Classical constituent of the second only if the first is tokened whenever the second is tokened The issues about how connectionists propose to obtain constituent structure non concatenatively tend to be complex and technical But they propose to exploit so called distributed representations in certain novel ways The essential idea behind most of them is to use vector and tensor algebra involving superimposition multiplication etc of vectors in composing and decomposing connectionist representations which consist in coding patterns of activity across neuron like units which can be modeled as vectors The result of such techniques is the production of representations that have in some interesting sense a complexity whose constituent structure is largely implicit in that the constituents are not tokened explicitly when the representations are tokened but can be recovered by further operations upon them The interested reader should consult some of the pioneering work by Elman Hinton Smolensky Touretzky Pollack criticism more specifically stated however is this Connectionists with such techniques only satisfy in some extended sense but they are incapable of satisfying precisely because their way of satisfying is committed to a non concatenative realization of syntactic structures Some connectionists disagree Chalmers Niklasson and van Gelder see also Browne and Browne and Sun for discussion and overview of models they claim that you can have structure sensitive transformations or operations defined over representations whose syntactic structure is non concatenatively realized So given the apparent agreement that non concatenative realization is what makes a system non classical connectionists claim that they can and do perfectly satisfy in its entirety with their connectionist models without implementing classical models The debate still continues and there is a growing literature built around the many issues raised by it Aydede offers an extensive analysis of the debate between classicists and this group of connectionists with special attention to the conceptual underpinnings of the debate See also Roth who argues that to the extent to which connectionist models can transform representations successfully according to an algorithmic function to that extent they count as executing program in the sense relevant to classical program execution Aydede argues that both parties are wrong in assuming that concatenative realization is relevant to the characterization of LOTH Part of the argument is that concatenative realization of is just that a realization The attentive reader might have noticed that there is nothing in the characterization of that requires concatenative realization Indeed when we look at all the major arguments for LOTH focused on the need for none of them requires concatenation or explicit realization of syntactic structure In fact it is almost on the border of confusion to necessarily associate LOTH to such an implementational level issue If anything this class of connectionist networks if successful and generalizable across all higher cognition contributes to our understanding of how radically differently a LOTH architecture could be implemented in neural networks Indeed if these models prove to be adequate for explaining the full range of human cognitive capacities they would show how syntactically structured representations and structure sensitive processes could be implemented in a radically new way So research programs in this niche are by no means trivial or insignificant But we need to be clear and careful about what minimally needs to be the case for LOTH to be true and why On the other hand it is by no means clear that these connectionist models are successful and generalizable scalable They all have proved to have serious limitations that seem to be tied to their particular ways of implementing variable binding syntactic structure and structure sensitive processing For critical discussion see Marcus Hadley Browne and Sun Marcus in particular makes a strong and largely empirical case for why classical symbol systems are needed for explaining human capacities of variable binding and generalizing and why existing connectionist models aren up to the job to match human capacities while remaining non classical Indeed the trend in the last fifteen years seems to be towards developing hybrid systems combining connectionist and classical symbol processing models see for instance the articles in Wermter and Sun Scope and Role of Distributive Principles Distributive principles vary in numerous dimensions They vary in what is considered relevant to distributive justice income wealth opportunities jobs welfare utility etc in the nature of the recipients of the distribution individual persons groups of persons reference classes etc and on what basis the distribution should be made equality maximization according to individual characteristics according to free transactions etc In this entry the focus is on principles designed to cover the distribution of benefits and burdens of economic activity among individuals in a society Although principles of this kind have been the dominant source of Anglo American debate about distributive justice over the last five decades there are other important distributive justice questions some of which are covered by other entries in the encyclopedia These include questions of distributive justice at the global level rather than just at the national level see justice international distributive justice across generations see justice intergenerational and how the topic of distributive justice can be approached not as a set of principles but as a virtue see justice as a virtue Although the numerous distributive principles vary along different dimensions for simplicity they are presented here in broad categories Even though these are common classifications in the literature it is important to keep in mind they necessarily involve over simplification particularly with respect to the criticisms of each of the groups of principles Some criticisms may not apply equally to every principle in the group The issue of how we are to understand and respond to criticisms of distributive principles is discussed briefly in the final section on methodology see Methodology Throughout most of history people were born into and largely stayed in a fairly rigid economic position The distribution of economic benefits and burdens was normally seen as fixed either by nature or by God Only when there was a widespread realization that the distribution of economic benefits and burdens could be affected by government did distributive justice become a live topic Now the topic is unavoidable Governments continuously make and change laws and policies affecting the distribution of economic benefits and burdens in their societies Almost all changes whether they regard tax industry education health etc have distributive effects As a result every society has a different distribution at any point in time and we are becoming increasingly more adept at measuring that distribution More importantly at every point in time now each society is faced with a choice about whether to stay with current laws policies etc or to modify them The practical contribution of distributive justice theory is to provide moral guidance for these constant choices Partly because many writers on distributive justice tend to advocate their particular principles by describing or considering ideal societies operating under them some readers may be misled to believe that discussions of distributive justice are merely exercises in ideal theory This is unfortunate because in the end distributive justice theory is a practical enterprise It is important to acknowledge that there has never been and never will be a purely libertarian society or Rawlsian society or any society whose distribution conforms to one of the proposed principles so rather than guiding ideal societies distributive principles provide moral guidance for the choices that each society faces now and every year So for instance advocates of Rawls Difference Principle are arguing that we should change our institutions to improve the life prospects of the least advantaged in society Others are arguing for changes to bring economic benefits and burdens more in accordance with what people deserve Libertarians are arguing that reductions in government intervention in the economy will better respect liberty and or self ownership of its citizens Sometimes a number of the theories will recommend the same changes other times they will diverge Another popular misconception about distributive justice is that it is readily avoidable by the population and or governments This reveals a confusion about the nature of the choices always facing each society To claim that we should not pursue any changes to our economic structures in light of a distributive justice argument is by its very nature to take a stand on the distributive justice of or if one prefers the morality of the current distribution and structures in the society compared to any of the possible alternative distributions and structures practically available At any particular moment the current economic framework is fundamentally affecting the economic and life prospects of everybody in the society To assert that we should not change the current system is to take a substantive moral stance on that distribution it is to say that it is morally preferable to any practical alternative proposed The should here has to be a moral should and if it is to be anything other than a bald assertion then the only type of argument that can back it up is one within the broad distributive justice tradition which includes principles which do not use justice per se such as utilitarianism but which are moral principles relating to distribution just the same So societies cannot avoid taking positions about distributive justice A related point can be made when people assert that economic structures and policy should be left to economists or when people assert that economic policy can be pursued without reference to distributive justice These assertions reveal misconceptions about what distributive justice and economics are and how they are related Positive economics at its best can tell us about economic causes and effects Positive economics is very important for distributive justice because it can give us guidance about which changes to pursue in order to better instantiate our moral principles What it cannot do in the absence of the principles is tell us what we should do This point is easily lost in everyday political discussion When an economist says The Central Bank should raise interest rates the general population often mistakenly believes the recommendation is purely coming from the science of economics It is not Moreover the should is almost always a moral should When economists make such a recommendation they sometimes unconsciously have taken off their social scientific hat They are employing alongside their positive economic theory a moral principle Often the moral evaluation being employed is not that controversial but suppressing that there are always moral arguments at play has had the effect of creating misconceptions about the role of distributive justice arguments in economic decision making For instance the raising of interest rates is typically thought by economists to have the dual effects of reducing inflation and reducing employment from what they otherwise would be Other things being equal most people think that reducing inflation is morally good and reducing employment is morally bad it makes more people unemployed or underemployed To get to a recommendation that the Central Bank should reduce interest rates involves not only empirical views about the relative sizes of the inflation and unemployment effects and their long term impact on growth etc but also normative views about the relative moral importance of inflation employment and growth For economists these normative views on economic policies come under the rubric of normative economics while philosophers would typically categorize them under distributive justice But the rubrics are not important as basically the same area is covered under different names the normative evaluation of economic policies structure institutions The evaluations often look different because economists most commonly use utility as their fundamental moral concept while philosophers use a wider variety of moral concepts but the task in which they are both engaged is the same What is most important to understand here is that positive economics alone cannot without the guidance of normative principles recommend which policies structures institutions to pursue The arguments and principles discussed in what follows aim to supply this kind of normative guidance Strict Egalitarianism One of the simplest principles of distributive justice is that of strict or radical equality The principle says that every person should have the same level of material goods and services The principle is most commonly justified on the grounds that people are morally equal and that equality in material goods and services is the best way to give effect to this moral ideal Even with this ostensibly simple principle some of the difficult specification problems of distributive principles can be seen The two main problems are the construction of appropriate indices for measurement the index problem and the specification of time frames Because there are numerous proposed solutions to these problems the principle of strict equality is not a single principle but a name for a group of closely related principles This range of possible specifications occurs with all the common principles of distributive justice The index problem arises primarily because the goods to be distributed need to be measured if they are going to be distributed according to some pattern such as equality The strict equality principle stated above says that there should be the same level of material goods and services The problem is how to specify and measure levels One way of solving the index problem in the strict equality case is to specify that everyone should have the same bundle of material goods and services rather than the same level so everyone would have oranges apples bike etc The main objection to this solution is that it appears likely that there will be many other allocations of material goods and services which will make some people better off without making anybody else worse off Such allocations are what are called Pareto superior allocations see equality for a more detailed discussion of Pareto efficiency For instance someone who prefers apples to oranges will be better off if she swaps some of her oranges for some of the apples belonging to a person who prefers oranges That way they are both better off and no one is worse off Indeed since most everyone will wish to trade something requiring identical bundles will make virtually everybody materially worse off than they would be under an alternative allocation So specifying that everybody must have the same bundle of goods does not seem to be a satisfactory way of solving the index problem Some index for measuring the value of goods and services is required Money is an index for the value of material goods and services It is an imperfect index whose pitfalls are documented in most economics textbooks Moreover once the goods to be allocated are extended beyond material ones to include goods such as opportunities money must be combined with other indices For instance John Rawls index of primary goods see Rawls Nevertheless using money either in the form of income or wealth or both as an index for the value of material goods and services is the most common response so far suggested to the index problem and is widely used in the specification and implementation of distributive principles The second main specification problem involves time frames Many distributive principles identify and require that a particular pattern of distribution be achieved or at least aimed at But they also need to specify when the pattern is required One version of the principle of strict equality requires that all people should have the same wealth at some initial point after which people are free to use their wealth in whatever way they choose with the consequence that future outcomes are bound to be unequal Principles specifying initial distributions after which the pattern need not be preserved are commonly called starting gate principles See Ackerman Alstott and Ackerman Because starting gate principles may eventually lead to large inequalities strict egalitarians do not usually favor them The most common form of strict equality principle specifies that income measured in terms of money should be equal in each time frame though even this may lead to significant disparities in wealth if variations in savings are permitted Hence strict equality principles are commonly conjoined with some society wide specification of just saving behavior see justice intergenerational In practice however this principle and the starting gate version might require more similar distributions than it first appears This is because the structure of the family means the requirement to give people equal starts will often necessitate redistribution to parents who due to bad luck bad management or simply their own choices have been unsuccessful in accruing or holding onto material goods There are a number of direct moral criticisms made of strict equality principles that they unduly restrict freedom that they do not give best effect to the moral equality of persons that they conflict with what people deserve etc see the sections on Libertarian Principles and Desert Based Principles and the entry on equality But the most common criticism is a welfare based one related to the Pareto efficiency requirement that everyone can be materially better off if incomes are not strictly equal Carens It is this criticism which partly inspired the Difference Principle The Difference Principle The wealth of an economy is not a fixed amount from one period to the next More wealth can be produced and indeed this has been the overwhelming feature of industrialized countries over the last couple of centuries The dominant economic view is that wealth is most readily increased in systems where those who are more productive earn greater incomes This economic view partly inspired the formulation of the Difference Principle The most widely discussed theory of distributive justice in the past four decades has been that proposed by John Rawls in A Theory of Justice Rawls and Political Liberalism Rawls Rawls proposes the following two principles of justice Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all and in this scheme the equal political liberties and only those liberties are to be guaranteed their fair value Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions a They are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity and they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society Rawls pp The principles are numbered as they were in Rawls original A Theory of Justice For Rawls uses an index of primary goods to measure the benefits of people for the purposes of the second principle Where the rules may conflict in practice Rawls says that Principle has lexical priority over Principle and Principle has lexical priority over As a consequence of the priority rules Rawls principles do not permit sacrifices to basic liberties in order to generate greater equality of opportunity or a higher level of material goods even for the worst off While it is possible to think of Principle as governing the distribution of liberties it is not commonly considered a principle of distributive justice given that it is not governing the distribution of economic goods per se Equality of opportunity is discussed in the next section In this section the primary focus will be on known as the Difference Principle The main moral motivation for the Difference Principle is similar to that for strict equality equal respect for persons Indeed the Difference Principle materially collapses to a form of strict equality under empirical conditions where differences in income have no effect on the work incentive of people The overwhelming economic opinion though is that in the foreseeable future the possibility of earning greater income will bring forth greater productive effort This will increase the total wealth of the economy and under the Difference Principle the wealth of the least advantaged Opinion divides on the size of the inequalities which would as a matter of empirical fact be allowed by the Difference Principle and on how much better off the least advantaged would be under the Difference Principle than under a strict equality principle Rawls principle however gives fairly clear guidance on what type of arguments will count as justifications for inequality Rawls is not opposed in principle to a system of strict equality per se his concern is about the absolute position of the least advantaged group rather than their relative position If a system of strict equality maximizes the absolute position of the least advantaged in society then the Difference Principle advocates strict equality If it is possible to raise the absolute position of the least advantaged further by having some inequalities of income and wealth then the Difference Principle prescribes inequality up to that point where the absolute position of the least advantaged can no longer be raised Because there has been such extensive discussion of the Difference Principle in the last years there have been numerous criticisms of it from the perspective of all the other theories of distributive justice outlined here Briefly the main criticisms are as follows Advocates of strict equality argue that inequalities permitted by the Difference Principle are unacceptable even if they do benefit the absolute position of the least advantaged The problem for these advocates has been to explain convincingly why society should be prevented from materially benefiting the least advantaged when this benefit requires a deviation from strict equality For the strict egalitarian the relative position of people is all important and the absolute position is either not important at all or lexically inferior For Rawls at least with respect to the social and economic inequalities the opposite is true But there have been various plausible explanations given in reply to Rawls proposed Difference Principle why relative position is a value that should be weighed against the value of the absolute position of the least advantaged rather than subordinated lexically to it In an early reply to Rawls Crocker explains the value of paying attention to the relative position as a way of understanding the value of solidarity His approach fits into a set of views in which being materially equal or striving towards it is an important expression of the equality of persons Another set of views in opposition to Rawls Difference Principle emphasizes the importance of relative position not as a value in itself but because of its effect on other relations In particular if some people are significantly better off materially than others then that can result in them having significant power over others Rawls response to this criticism appeals to the priority of his first principle The inequalities consistent with the Difference Principle are only permitted so long as they do not compromise the fair value of the political liberties So for instance very large wealth differentials may make it practically impossible for poor people to be elected to political office or to have their political views represented These inequalities of wealth even if they increase the material position of the least advantaged group may need to be reduced in order for the first principle to be implemented However while this provides a partial reply to Rawls critics it does not seem to recognize that it is not just differential political power that can come from significant differences in economic position but also economic power and hence economic freedom Virtual monopoly employers in regions of developing economies give a stark illustration of this phenomenon Of course Rawls can appeal in such cases to the empirical claim that such differentials do not maximize the long term position of the least advantaged The empirical question will be whether all such large differentials which result in large differences in economic power also demonstrably have the result of worsening the absolute position of the least advantaged The utilitarian objection to the Difference Principle is that it does not maximize utility In A Theory of Justice Rawls uses utilitarianism as the main theory for comparison with his own and hence he offers a number of arguments in response to this utilitarian objection some of which are outlined in the section on Welfare Based Principles Libertarians object that the Difference Principle involves unacceptable infringements on liberty property rights or self ownership For instance the Difference Principle may require redistributive taxation for the benefit of the poor and libertarians commonly object that such taxation involves the immoral taking of just holdings see Libertarian Principles The Difference Principle is also criticized as a primary distributive principle on the grounds that it mostly ignores claims that people deserve certain economic benefits in light of their actions Advocates of desert based principles argue that some may deserve a higher level of material goods because of their hard work or contributions even if their unequal rewards do not also function to improve the position of the least advantaged Desert theorists as well as libertarians also argue that the explanation of how people come to be in more or less advantaged positions is morally relevant to their fairness yet the Difference Principle ignores these explanations Like desert theorists advocates of Luck Egalitarian principles argue that the Difference Principle does not fully capture the moral roles they believe luck and responsibility should play in principles of distributive justice Indeed luck egalitarianism as a distinct approach in the distributive justice literature really developed in critical response to Rawls theory of distributive justice The reasons for that response are outlined in the next section Equality of Opportunity and Luck Egalitarianism The distribution of material goods and services is not the only economic distribution which is important to people The distribution of opportunities is also important As noted in the previous section John Rawls conjoined his Difference Principle with a principle of equality of opportunity Endorsement of some form of equality of opportunity is very prevalent among distributive justice theorists and indeed among the general population especially when combined with some form of market distributive mechanism Equality of opportunity is often contrasted favorably with equality of outcome or strict egalitarianism by those who believe that we can show equal concern respect or treatment of people without them having the same material goods and services so long as they have equal economic opportunities What is the morally best interpretation of this equality of opportunity principle has been a significant focus of research particularly among luck egalitarians In Brian Barry gave an interesting reconstruction of the reasoning which led John Rawls to his Equal Opportunity and Difference Principles Barry reconstruction and Ronald Dworkin earlier discussion which we will come to later have been seminal in the luck egalitarian literature A version of this argument is probably the best introduction to some of the relevant moral issues Formal equality of opportunity rules out formal discrimination on grounds such as a person race ethnicity age or gender What is the underlying concern shared by most theorists and the general population with a society lacking formal equality of opportunity The concern seems to be rooted in the belief that traits such as a persons gender or race are elements over which people have no control and hence a society in which people race or gender have fundamental effects on their lifetime economic prospects treats people unfairly In such societies whether people were born as the favored gender or race and hence were favored economically would simply be a matter of luck Rawls claim is that structuring a society so that this natural lottery has such fundamental effects on people lives is immoral when we have the option to structure it another way with a system of formal equality of opportunity The foregoing is relatively uncontroversial but what made Rawls and Barry arguments so interesting was their claim that this line of reasoning actually leads to much stronger requirements for social justice They note that even with formal equality of opportunity there will remain many factors over which people have no control but which will affect their lifetime economic prospects such as whether a person family can afford to purchase good quality educational opportunities or health care A society therefore will have reasons to adopt a more substantial equality of opportunity principle with equal opportunities for education health care etc the same reasons it had for adopting a merely formal equality of opportunity principle Following this line of reasoning further and it certainly has appeared to many that we have no principled reason to stop here seems to lead to more radical conclusions than those who agreed with formal equality of opportunity would have imagined A society with a more substantial equality of opportunity principle in place will still not be providing equality of opportunity for all People are born into more or less nurturing families and social circumstances People are born into families and neighborhoods which are more or less encouraging of education and the development of economically advantageous talents There are a whole range of social influences which have fundamental and unequal effects on children economic prospects and for which they are in no way responsible the influences children are exposed to are a matter of their luck in the social lottery Moreover the luck of the natural lottery is not just restricted to such characteristics as gender and race Children are more or less fortunate in the distribution of natural talents as well A race where the starting line is arbitrarily staggered where people prospects for winning are not largely determined by factors for which they are responsible but rather largely by luck is not considered a fair race Similarly if society is structured so that people prospects for gaining more economic goods are not largely determined by factors for which they are responsible but rather largely by luck then the society is open to the charge of being unfair This is the challenging conclusion with which Barry following Rawls presents us In response to this challenge Barry himself explores a number of avenues including questioning whether economic distribution is really analogous to a race Rawls of course responded to his own challenge by arguing that there is not a lot that can be done morally to make the social and natural opportunities more equal so the fair response is to adopt the Difference Principle Others however have taken this challenge in different directions Ronald Dworkin Dworkin provided one of the most detailed early responses to Rawls challenge In retrospect Dworkin theory is often identified as one of the earliest in the luck egalitarian literature though Dworkin himself called his theory Resource Egalitarianism Dworkin presented his key insight what distinguishes him from Rawls in terms of a distinction between ambitions and endowments Dworkin uses the term ambitions to cover the realm of our choices and what results from our choices such as the choice to work hard or to spend money on expensive luxuries His term endowments refers to the results of brute luck or those things over which we have no control such as one genetic inheritance or unforeseeable bad luck Dworkin agrees with Rawls that natural inequalities are not distributed according to people choices nor are they justified by reference to some other morally relevant fact about people so people should not end up worse off as a result of bad luck in the natural lottery However Dworkin argues the Difference Principle fails to deliver on this ideal since its formulation in terms of primary goods fails to recognize that those who are very unlucky such as the severely ill or disabled may need considerably greater shares of primary goods than others in order to achieve a reasonable life Dworkin also argued that just economic distributions should be more responsive than the Difference Principle to the consequences of people choices Dworkin proposed that people begin with equal resources but be allowed to end up with unequal economic benefits as a result of their own choices What constitutes a just material distribution is to be determined by the result of a thought experiment designed to model fair distribution Suppose that everyone is given the same purchasing power and each uses that purchasing power to bid in a fair auction for resources best suited to their life plans They are then permitted to use those resources as they see fit Although people may end up with different economic benefits none of them is given less consideration than another in the sense that if they wanted somebody else resource bundle they could have bid for it instead In Dworkin proposal we see his attitudes to ambitions and endowments which have become a central feature of luck egalitarianism though under a wide variety of alternative names and further subset distinctions In terms of sensitivity to ambitions Dworkin and many other luck egalitarians argue that provided people have an equal starting point in Dworkin case resources they should live with the consequences of their choices They argue for instance that people who choose to work hard to earn more income should not be required to subsidize those choosing more leisure and hence less income With respect to endowments Dworkin proposes a hypothetical compensation scheme in which he supposes that before the hypothetical auction described above people do not know their own natural endowments However they are able to buy insurance against being disadvantaged in the natural distribution of talents and they know that their payments will provide an insurance pool to compensate those people who are unlucky in the natural lottery Dworkin early proposals were very hypothetical and it was somewhat difficult to see what they meant in practice Later luck egalitarians have tried to tease out the practical implications of their theories in more detail though much of the debate still remains at the theoretical level They agree with Dworkin recommendation against Rawls Difference Principle approach that those with unequal natural endowments should receive compensation For instance people born with handicaps or ill health who have not brought these circumstances upon themselves can be explicitly compensated so that they are not disadvantaged in their economic prospects Under Rawls Difference Principle though no such explicit compensation is forthcoming as Rawls says the Difference Principle is not the principle of redress Rawls Of course for the subset of people with long term handicaps or ill health who are also in the least advantaged group variously defined by Rawls but most commonly defined as the lowest socio economic grouping the Difference Principle will help But the help will not be proportionate to their needs arising from their handicaps or ill health Luck egalitarians continue to refine such aspects of their theories as a what they believe is the relevant conception of equality of opportunity how much of a role luck should play in the distribution of economic benefits and what is the best conception of luck Arneson and Fleurbaey Swift Sher Relatedly they continue to explore what role responsibility should play in the distribution of economic goods Sen Cohen Valentyne Knight Because the luck egalitarian proposals have a similar motivation to the Difference Principle the moral criticisms of them tend to be variations on those leveled against the Difference Principle However as noted above what is practically required of a society operating under the Difference Principle is relatively straightforward How the theoretical concerns of luck egalitarians are to be practically implemented is often not so clear For instance it has seemed impossible to measure differences in people natural talents unfortunately people talents do not neatly divide into the natural and those for which people can be held responsible A system of special assistance to the physically and mentally handicapped and to the ill would be a partial implementation of the compensation system but most natural inequalities would be left untouched by such assistance while the theories commonly require compensation for such inequalities Exploring how in practical ways the economic systems can be refined to track responsibility while mitigating certain types of pure luck will be an ongoing challenge for luck egalitarians Welfare Based Principles Welfare based principles are motivated by the idea that what is of primary moral importance is the level of welfare of people Advocates of welfare based principles view the concerns of other theories material equality the level of primary goods of the least advantaged resources desert claims or liberty as derivative concerns They are only valuable in so far as they affect welfare so that all distributive questions should be settled entirely by how the distribution affects welfare However there are many ways that welfare can be used in answering these distributive questions so welfare theorists need to specify what welfare function they believe should be maximized The welfare functions proposed vary according to what will count as welfare and the weighting system for that welfare Economists defending some form of welfarism normally state the explicit functional form while philosophers often avoid this formality concentrating on developing their theories in answer to two questions the question of what has intrinsic value and the question of what actions or policies would maximize the intrinsic value Moreover philosophers tend to restrict themselves to a small subset of the available welfare functions Although there are a number of advocates of alternative welfare functions such as equality of well being most philosophical activity has concentrated on a variant known as utilitarianism This theory can be used to illustrate most of the main characteristics of welfare based principles Historically utilitarians have used the term utility rather than welfare and utility has been defined variously as pleasure happiness or preference satisfaction Jeremy Bentham the historical father of utilitarianism argued that the experience of pleasure was the only thing with intrinsic value and all other things had intstrumental value insofar as they contribute to the experience of pleasure or the avoidance of pain His student John Stuart Mill broadened this theory of intrinsic value to include happiness or fulfillment Modern philosophers since Kenneth Arrow though tend to argue that intrinsic value consists in preference satisfaction in individuals having what they want So for instance the principle for distributing economic benefits for preference utilitarians is to distribute them so as to maximize preference satisfaction The welfare function for such a principle has a relatively simple theoretical form which requires choosing the distribution which maximizes the arithmetic sum of all satisfied preferences unsatisfied preferences being negative weighted for the intensity of those preferences To accommodate uncertainty with respect to outcomes the function can be modified so that expected utility rather than utility is maximized see consequentialism The basic theory of utilitarianism is one of the simplest to state and understand Much of the work on the theory therefore has been directed towards defending it against moral criticisms particularly from the point of view of commonsense morality The criticisms and responses have been widely discussed in the literature on utilitarianism as a general moral theory see consequentialism Two of the most widely discussed criticisms will be mentioned here The first which was famously articulated by John Rawls is that utilitarianism fails to take seriously the distinctness of persons Maximization of preference satisfaction is often taken as prudent in the case of individuals people may take on greater burdens suffering or sacrifice at certain periods of their lives so that their lives are overall better The complaint against utilitarianism is that it takes this principle commonly described as prudent for individuals and uses it on an entity society unlike individuals in important ways While it may be acceptable for a person to choose to suffer at some period in her life be it a day or a number of years so that her overall life is better it is often argued against utilitarianism that it is immoral to make some people suffer so that there is a net gain for other people In the individual case there is a single entity experiencing both the sacrifice and the gain Also the individuals who suffer or make the sacrifices choose to do so in order to gain some benefit they deem worth their sacrifice In the case of society as a whole there is no single experiential entity some people suffer or are sacrificed so that others may gain Furthermore under utilitarianism there is no requirement for people to consent to the suffering or sacrifice nor is there necessarily a unified belief in the society that the outcome is worth the cost A related criticism of utilitarianism involves the way it treats individual preferences about other peoples welfare or holdings For instance some people may have a preference that the members of some minority racial group have less material benefits Under utilitarian theories in their classical form this preference or interest counts like any other in determining the best distribution Hence if racial preferences are widespread and are not outweighed by the minority contrary preferences perhaps because the minority is relatively few in number compared to the majority utilitarianism will recommend an inegalitarian distribution based on race if there is not some other utility maximizing alternative on offer utilitarians have responded to these criticisms in a number of ways utilitarians may believe that even more welfare in the long run can be achieved by re educating the majority so that racist preferences weaken or disappear over time leading to a more harmonious and happier world However the utilitarian must supply an account of why racist or sexist preferences should be discouraged if the same level of total long term utility could be achieved by encouraging the less powerful to be content with a lower position Utilitarians have also argued that the empirical conditions are such that utility maximizing will rarely require racial minorities to sacrifice or suffer for the benefit of others or to satisfy the prejudices of others But if their theory on rare occasions does require people sacrifice or suffer in these ways utilitarians have defended this unintuitive consequence on the grounds that our judgments about what is wrong provide us with rules of thumb which are useful at the level of commonsense morality but ultimately mistaken at the level of critical theory More recently some utilitarians have drawn on institutional theory or game theory in defence or in modification of utilitarianism see Hardin Goodin Bailey Noting that the consequences of individual actions are rarely determined in isolation but rather in conjunction with the actions of many others these Institutional utilitarians argue that morally intuitive institutions such as constitutional rights human rights and various property rights would be endorsed by utilitarianism and would forbid the morally horrible outcomes critics have feared utilitarianism could sanction Utilitarian distribution principles like the other principles described here have problems with specification and implementation Most formulations of utilitarianism require interpersonal comparisons of utility This means for instance that we must be able to compare the utility one person gains from eating an apple with that another gains from eating an apple Furthermore utilitarianism requires that differences in utility be measured and summed for widely disparate goods so for instance the amount of utility a particular person gains from playing football is measured and compared with the amount of utility another gains from eating a gourmet meal Some critics have argued that such interpersonal utility comparisons are impossible even in theory because even if the already significant challenge of combining all the diverse goods into a single index of utility could be met for an individual there is no conceptually adequate way of calibrating such a measure among individuals see Elster Utilitarians face a greater problem than this theoretical one in determining what material distribution is prescribed by their theory Those who share similar utilitarian theoretical principles frequently recommend very different material distributions to implement the principle This problem occurs for other theories but appears worse for utilitarian and welfare based distribution principles Recommendations for distributions or economic structures to implement other distributive principles commonly vary among advocates with similar theoretical principles but the advocates tend to cluster around particular recommendations This is not the case for utilitarianism with adherents dispersed in their recommendations across the full range of possible distributions and economic structures For instance many preference utilitarians believe their principle prescribes strongly egalitarian structures with lots of state intervention while other preference utilitarians believe it prescribes a laissez faire style of capitalism There is an explanation for why utilitarians are faced with greater difficulties in implementation Other distributive principles can rule out relatively quickly some practical policies on the grounds that they clearly violate the guiding principle but utilitarians must examine in great detail all the policies on offer For each policy they must determine the distribution of goods and services yielded by the policy and at least three other factors the identity of each person in the distribution if individuals utility functions differ the utility of each person from the goods and services distributed to them the utility of each person from the policy itself The size of the information requirements make this task impossible Hence broad assumptions must be made and each different set of assumptions will yield a different answer and so the answers range across the full set of policies on offer Moreover there is no obvious way to arbitrate between the different sets of assumptions For instance suppose three utilitarians agree on the same utilitarian distributive principle Utilitarian for example may assert that the population utility function conforms to function A people marginal utility is linear in the goods and services they consume and is maximized by Policy Utilitarian however asserts that half the population utility function conforms to function A and half to function people marginal utility is diminishing and is maximized by Policy Utilitarian furthermore asserts Utilitarian is correct about the utility functions of the population but claims that Policy will maximize utility What seems impossible for advocates of utilitarian distribution principles to answer is how we would arbitrate these claims If utilitarian principles are to play a role in debates about distributive justice then this is the most important question to answer Desert Based Principles Another complaint against welfarism is that it ignores and in fact cannot even make sense of claims that people deserve certain economic benefits in light of their actions Feinberg Lamont The complaint is often motivated by the concern that various forms of welfarism treat people as mere containers for well being rather than purposeful beings responsible for their actions and creative in their environments The different desert based principles of distribution differ primarily according to what they identify as the basis for deserving While Aristotle proposed virtue or moral character to be the best desert basis for economic distribution contemporary desert theorists have proposed desert bases that are more practically implemented in complex modern societies Most contemporary desert theorists have pursued John Locke lead in this respect Locke argued people deserve to have those items produced by their toil and industry the products or the value thereof being a fitting reward for their effort see Miller Locke underlying idea was to guarantee to individuals the fruits of their own labor and abstinence Most contemporary proposals for desert bases fit into one of three broad categories Contribution People should be rewarded for their work activity according to the value of their contribution to the social product Miller Miller Riley Effort People should be rewarded according to the effort they expend in their work activity Sadurski Milne Compensation People should be rewarded according to the costs they incur in their work activity Dick Lamont According to the contemporary desert theorist people freely apply their abilities and talents in varying degrees to socially productive work People come to deserve varying levels of income by providing goods and services desired by others Feinberg Distributive systems are just insofar as they distribute incomes according to the different levels earned or deserved by the individuals in the society for their productive labors efforts or contributions Contemporary desert principles all share the value of raising the standard of living collectively the social product Under each principle only activity directed at raising the social product will serve as a basis for deserving income The concept of desert itself does not yield this value of raising the social product it is a value societies hold independently Hence desert principles identifying desert bases tied to socially productive activity productivity compensation and effort all being examples of such bases do not do so because the concept of desert requires this They do so because societies value higher standards of living and therefore choose the raising of living standards as the primary value relevant to desert based distribution This means that the full development of desert based principles requires specification and defense of those activities which will or will not count as socially productive and hence as deserving of remuneration Lamont It is important to distinguish desert payments from entitlements For desert theorists a well designed institutional structure will make it so that many of the entitlements people have are deserved But entitlements and just deserts can come apart As Feinberg notes a person can be entitled to assume the presidential office without deserving it Feinberg and a person who accidentally apprehends a criminal may be entitled to a reward but not deserve it Conversely a team may deserve to win the championship prize but not entitled to it or a person may deserve an economic benefit but not be entitled to it These instances of desert and entitlements coming apart are typical fertile grounds for a desert theorist to argue for institutional reform Payments designed to give people incentives are a form of entitlement particularly worth distinguishing from desert payments as they are commonly confused Barry Incentive payments are forward looking in that they are set up to create a situation in the future while desert payments are backwards looking in that they are justified with reference to work in the present or past Even though it is possible for the same payment to be both deserved and an incentive incentives and desert provide distinct rationales for income and should not be conflated Lamont While some have sought to justify current capitalist distributions via desert based distributive principles John Stuart Mill and many since have forcefully argued the contrary claim that the implementation of a productivity principle would involve dramatic changes in modern market economies and would greatly reduce the inequalities characteristic of them It is important to note though that contemporary desert based principles are rarely complete distributive principles They usually are only designed to cover distribution among working adults leaving basic welfare needs to be met by other principles The specification and implementation problems for desert based distribution principles revolve mainly around the desert bases it is difficult to identify what is to count as a contribution an effort or a cost and it is even more difficult to measure these in a complex modern economy The main moral objection to desert based principles is that they make economic benefits depend on factors over which people have little control John Rawls has made one of the most widely discussed arguments to this effect Rawls and while the strong form of this argument has been clearly refuted Zaitchik Sher it remains a problem for desert based principles The problem is most pronounced in the case of productivity based principles a person productivity seems clearly to be influenced by many factors over which the person has little control It is interesting to note that under most welfare based principles it is also the case that people level of economic benefits depends on factors beyond their control But welfarists view this as a virtue of their theory since they think the only morally relevant characteristic of any distribution is the welfare resulting from it Whether the distribution ties economic benefits to matters beyond our control is morally irrelevant from the welfarist point of view As it happens welfarists often hold the empirical claim that people have little control over their contributions to society anyway However for people benefits to depend on factors beyond their control is a more awkward result for desert theorists who emphasize the responsibility of people in choosing to engage in more or less productive activities Libertarian Principles Most contemporary versions of the principles discussed so far allow some role for the market as a means of achieving the desired distributive pattern the Difference Principle uses it as a means of helping the least advantaged utilitarian principles commonly use it as a means of achieving the distributive pattern maximizing utility desert based principles rely on it to distribute goods according to desert etc In contrast advocates of libertarian distributive principles rarely see the market as a means to some desired pattern since the principle they advocate do not ostensibly propose a pattern at all but instead describe the sorts of acquisitions or exchanges which are just in their own right The market will be just not as a means to some pattern but insofar as the exchanges permitted in the market satisfy the conditions of just acquisition and exchange described by the principles For libertarians just outcomes are those arrived at by the separate just actions of individuals a particular distributive pattern is not required for justice Robert Nozick has advanced this version of libertarianism Nozick and is its best known contemporary advocate Nozick proposes a part Entitlement Theory If the world were wholly just the following definition would exhaustively cover the subject of justice in holdings A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in acquisition is entitled to that holding A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in transfer from someone else entitled to the holding is entitled to the holding No one is entitled to a holding except by repeated applications of a and The complete principle of distributive justice would say simply that a distribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they possess under the distribution Nozick The statement of the Entitlement Theory includes reference to the principles of justice in acquisition and transfer For details of these principles see Nozick pp The principle of justice in transfer is the least controversial and is designed to specify fair contracts while ruling out stealing fraud etc The principle of justice in acquisition is more complicated and more controversial The principle is meant to govern the gaining of exclusive property rights over the material world For the justification of these rights Nozick takes his inspiration from John Locke idea that everyone owns themselves and by mixing one labors with the world self ownership can generate ownership of some part of the material world However of Locke mixing metaphor Nozick legitimately asks why isn mixing what I own with what I don own a way of losing what I own rather than a way of gaining what I don If I own a can of tomato juice and spill it in the sea so its molecules mingle evenly throughout the sea do I thereby come to own the sea or have I foolishly dissipated my tomato juice Nozick Nozick concludes that what is significant about mixing our labor with the material world is that in doing so we tend to increase the value of it so that self ownership can lead to ownership of the external world in such cases Nozick pp The obvious objection to this claim is that it is not clear why the first people to acquire some part of the material world should be able to exclude others from it and for instance be the land owners while the later ones become the wage laborers In response to this objection Nozick follows Locke in recognizing the need for a qualification on just acquisition According to the Lockean Proviso an exclusive acquisition of the external world is just if after the acquisition there is enough and as good left in common for others One of the main challenges for libertarians has been to formulate a morally plausible interpretation of this proviso According to Nozick weaker version of Locke Proviso a process normally giving rise to a permanent bequeathable property right in a previously unowned thing will not do so if the position of others no longer at liberty to use the thing is thereby worsened Nozick For Nozick critics his proviso is unacceptably weak This is because it fails to consider the position others may have achieved under alternative distributions and thereby instantiates the morally dubious criterion of whoever is first gets the exclusive spoils For example one can satisfy Nozick proviso by acquiring a beach and charging admission to those who previously were able to use the beach for free so long as one compensates them with a benefit they deem equally valuable such as a clean up or life guarding service on the beach However the beach goers would have been even better off had the more efficient organizer among them acquired the beach charging only cents for the same service but this alternative is never considered under Nozick proviso Cohen Will Kymlicka has given a summary of the steps in Nozick self ownership argument People own themselves The world is initially unowned You can acquire absolute rights over a disproportionate share of the world if you do not worsen the condition of others It is relatively easy without worsening the condition of others to acquire absolute rights over a disproportionate share of the world Therefore Once private property has been appropriated a free market in capital and labor is morally required Kymlicka The assessment of this argument is quite complex but the difficulties mentioned above with the proviso call into question claims and The challenge for libertarians then is to find a plausible reading of which will yield Moreover Nozick extends the operation of the proviso to apply both to acquisitions and transfers compounding the problem Nozick Of course many existing holdings are the result of acquisitions or transfers which at some point did not satisfy the principles of justice for acquisitions or transfers Hence Nozick must supplement those principles with a principle of rectification for past injustice Although he does not specify this principle he does describe its purpose This principle uses historical information about previous situations and injustices done in them and information about the actual course of events that flowed from these injustices until the present and it yields a description or descriptions of holdings in the society The principle of rectification presumably will make use of its best estimate of subjunctive information about what would have occurred if the injustice had not taken place If the actual description of holdings turns out not to be one of the descriptions yielded by the principle then one of the descriptions yielded must be realized Nozick pp Nozick does not make an attempt to provide a principle of rectification The absence of such a principle is much worse for a historical theory than for a patterned theory Past injustices systematically undermine the justice of every subsequent distribution in historical theories Nozick is clear that his historical theory cannot be used to evaluate the justice of actual societies until such a theory of rectification is given or no considerations of rectification of injustice could apply to justify the distribution in the actual society In the absence of a full treatment of the principle of rectification applied to a particular society one cannot use the analysis and theory presented here to condemn any particular scheme of transfer payments unless it is clear that no considerations of rectification of injustice could apply to justify it Nozick Unfortunately for the theory it would seem that no such treatment will ever be forthcoming because the task is for all practical purposes impossible The numbers of injustices perpetrated throughout history both within nations and between them are enormous and the necessary details of the vast majority of injustices are unavailable Even if the details of the injustices were available the counterfactual causal chains could not be reliably determined As Derek Parfit has pointed out in a different context even the people who would have been born would have been different Parfit As a consequence it is difficult to see how Nozick entitlement theory could provide guidance as to what the current distribution of material holdings should be or what distributions or redistributions are legitimate or illegitimate Indeed Nozick suggests for instance the Difference Principle may be the best implementation of the principle of rectification Although Nozick is fairly candid about this consequence many of his supporters and critics have ignored it and have carried on a vigorous debate as though contrary to Nozick own statement his theory can be used to evaluate the justice of current economic distributions Libertarians usually advocate a system in which there are exclusive property rights with the role of the government restricted to the protection of these property rights The property rights commonly rule out taxation for purposes other than raising the funds necessary to protect property rights One of the strongest critiques of any attempt to institute such a system of legally protected strong property rights comes as we have seen from Nozick theory itself there seems no obvious reason to give strong legal protection to property rights which have arisen through violations of the just principles of acquisition and transfer But putting this critique to one side for a moment what other arguments are made in favor of exclusionary property rights As already noted Nozick argues that because people own themselves and hence their talents they own whatever they can produce with these talents Moreover it is possible in a free market to sell the products of exercising one talents Any taxation of the income from such selling according to Nozick institute partial ownership by others of people and their actions and labor Nozick People according to this argument have these exclusive rights of ownership Taxation then simply involves violating these rights and allowing some people to own partially other people Moreover it is argued any system not legally recognizing these rights violates Kant maxim to treat people always as ends in themselves and never merely as a means The two main difficulties with this argument have been to show that self ownership is only compatible with having such strong exclusive property rights and that a system of exclusive property rights is the best system for treating people with respect as ends in themselves Nozick candidly accepts that he does not himself give a systematic moral justification of the exclusionary property rights he advocates This book does not present a precise theory of the moral basis of individual rights Nozick xiv But others have tried to provide more systematic justifications of similar rights Lomasky Steiner or to develop more fully justifications to which Nozick alludes In addition to the arguments from self ownership and the requirement to treat people as ends in themselves the most common other route for trying to justify exclusive property rights has been to argue that they are required for the maximization of freedom and or liberty or the minimization of violations of these Hayek As an empirical claim though this appears to be false If we compare countries with less exclusionary property rights more taxation with countries with more exclusionary property regimes we see no systematic advantage in freedoms liberties enjoyed by people in the latter countries Of course we do see a difference in distribution of such freedoms liberties in the latter countries the richer have more and the poorer less while in the former they are more evenly distributed Now if libertarians restrict what counts as a valuable freedom liberty and discount other freedoms liberties people value it will follow that exclusionary property rights are required to maximize freedom liberty or to minimize violations of these But the challenge for these libertarians is to show why only their favored liberties and freedoms are valuable and not those which are weakened by a system of exclusive property rights Feminist Principles There is no one feminist conception of distributive justice theorists who name themselves feminists defend positions across the political spectrum Hence feminists offer distinctive versions of all the theories considered so far as well as others One way of thinking about what unifies many feminist theorists is an interest in what difference if any the practical experience of gender makes to the subject matter or study of justice how different feminists answer this question distinguishes them from each other and from those alternative distributive principles that most inspire their thinking The distributive principles so far outlined with the exception of strict egalitarianism are often described as falling under the broad classification of liberalism they both inform and are the product of the liberal democracies which have emerged over the last two centuries Lumping them together this way though clumsy makes the task of understanding the emergence of feminist critiques and the subsequent positive theories much easier John Stuart Mill in The Subjection of Women gives one of the clearest early feminist critiques of the political and distributive structures of the emerging liberal democracies His writings provide the starting point for many contemporary liberal feminists Mill argued that the principles associated with the developing liberalism of his time required equal political status for women The principles Mill explicitly mentions include a rejection of the aristocracy of birth equal opportunity in education and in the marketplace equal rights to hold property a rejection of the man as the legal head of the household and equal rights to political participation Feminists who follow Mill believe that a proper recognition of the position of women in society requires that women be given equal and the same rights as men have and that these primarily protect their liberty and their status as equal persons under the law Thus government regulation should not prevent women from competing on equal terms with men in educational professional marketplace and political institutions From the point of view of other feminisms the liberal feminist position is a conservative one in the sense that it requires the proper inclusion for women of the rights protections and opportunities previously secured for men rather than a fundamental change to the traditional liberal position The problem for women on this view is not liberalism but the failure of society and the State to properly instantiate liberal principles One phrase or motto around which a whole range of feminists have rallied however marks a significant break with Mill liberalism the personal is political Feminists have offered a variety of interpretations of this motto many of which take the form of a critique of liberal theories Mill was crucial in developing the liberal doctrine of limiting the state intervention in the private lives of citizens Many contemporary feminists have argued that the resulting liberal theories of justice have fundamentally been unable to accommodate the injustices that have their origins in this protected private sphere This particular feminist critique has also been a primary source of inspiration for the broader multicultural critique of liberalism The liberal commitments to government neutrality and to a protected personal sphere of liberty where the government must not interfere have been primary critical targets While issues about neutrality and personal liberty go beyond debates about distributive justice they also have application within these debates The feminist critics recognize that liberalism correctly identifies the government as one potential source of oppression against individuals and therefore recommends powerful political protections of individual liberty They argue however that liberal theories of distributive justice are unable to address the oppression which surfaces in the so called private sphere of government non interference Susan Moller Okin for example documents the effects of the institution of the nuclear family arguing that the consequence of this institution is a position of systematic material and political inequality for women Standard liberal theories committed to neutrality in the private sphere seem powerless to address or sometimes even recognize striking and lasting inequalities for women minorities or historically oppressed racial groups when these are merely the cumulative effect of individuals free behavior Okin and others demonstrate for example that women have substantial disadvantages in competing in the market because of childrearing responsibilities which are not equally shared with men As a consequence any theory relying on market mechanisms including most liberal theories will yield systems which result in women systematically having less income and wealth than men Thus feminists have challenged contemporary political theorists to rethink the boundaries of political authority in the name of securing a just outcome for women and other historically oppressed groups While the political effects of personal freedom pose a serious challenge to contemporary liberal theories of distributive justice the feminist critiques are somewhat puzzling because as Jean Hampton puts it many feminists appear to complain in the name of liberal values In other words their claims about the fundamental flaws of liberalism at the same time leave in tact the various ideals of liberty and equality which inspire the liberal theories of justice Moreover the task of defining feasible pathways for modifying the structure of liberal democracies without undermining their virtues and protections has proved more difficult than setting out the criticisms of liberalism Indeed despite a legitimate feminist worry about the effects of so called government neutrality on women material status the relative neutrality of liberal democracies compared to non liberal societies has been one of the significant contributing factors both to the flourishing of feminist theory and to the many significant practical gains women in liberal democracies have made relative to women in other parts of the world The challenge being taken up by many is to navigate both a coherent theoretical and practical path in response to the best feminist critiques available see the entry on feminist ethics Methodology and Empirical Beliefs about Distributive Justice How are we to go about choosing between the different distributive principles on offer and respond to criticisms of the principles Unfortunately few philosophers explicitly discuss the methodology they are using The most notable exception is John Rawls who explicitly brought the method of wide reflective equilibrium to political philosophy This method has been brilliantly discussed by Norman Daniels over the years and the reader is strongly encouraged to refer to his entry see reflective equilibrium to understand how to evaluate revise and choose between normative principles While there is no point in reiterating the method here there are some supplementary issues worth noting Empirical data on the beliefs of the population about distributive justice was not available when Rawls published A Theory of Justice Rawls but much empirical work has since been completed Swift and Miller chaps have provided surveys of this literature and arguments for why those committed to the method of reflective equilibrium in distributive justice should take the beliefs of the population seriously though not uncritically Indeed some go even further arguing that the distributive decisions arising through the legitimate application of particular democratic processes might even at least in part constitute distributive justice Walzer Data on people beliefs about distributive justice is also useful for addressing the necessary intersection between philosophical and political processes Such beliefs put constraints on what institutional and policy reforms are practically achievable in any generation especially when the society is committed to democratic processes Two final methodological issues need to be noted The first concerns the distinctive role counterexamples play in debates about distributive justice As noted above the overarching methodological concern of the distributive justice literature must be in the first instance the pressing choice of how the benefits and burdens of economic activity should be distributed rather than the mere uncovering of abstract truth Principles are to be implemented in real societies with the problems and constraints inherent in such application Given this pointing out that the application of any particular principle will have some perhaps many immoral results will not by itself constitute a fatal counterexample to any distributive theory Such counter evidence to a theory would only be fatal if there were an alternative or improved version of the theory which if fully implemented would yield a morally preferable society overall So it is at least possible that the best distributive theory when implemented might yield a system which still has many injustices and or negative consequences This practical aspect partly distinguishes the role of counterexamples in distributive justice theory from many other philosophical areas Given that distributive justice is about what to do now not just what to think alternate distributive theories must in part compete as comprehensive systems which take into account the practical constraints we face The second and related methodological point is that the evaluation of alternate distributive principles requires us and their advocates to consider the application of the distributive principle in the world If it is uncertain or indeterminate how a particular distributive principle might in practice apply to the ordering of real societies then this principle is not yet a serious candidate for our consideration This is also true of principles whose implementation is practically impossible given the institutional psychological informational administrative technical constraints of a society Distributive justice is not an area where we can say an idea is good in theory but not in practice If it is not good in practice then it is not good

theories magnify understanding help supply legitimate explanations and assist in formulating predictions Moving from their knowledge producing representational functions to their interventional roles Hacking theories are integral to building technologies used within consumer industrial and scientific milieus This entry explores the structure of scientific theories from the perspective of the Syntactic Semantic and Pragmatic Views Each of these answers questions such as the following in unique ways What is the best characterization of the composition and function of scientific theory How is theory linked with world Which philosophical tools can and should be employed in describing and reconstructing scientific theory Is an understanding of practice and application necessary for a comprehension of the core structure of a scientific theory Finally and most generally how are these three views ultimately related Population Genetics Conclusion Introduction In philosophy three families of perspectives on scientific theory are operative the Syntactic View the Semantic View and the Pragmatic View Savage distills these philosophical perspectives thus The syntactic view that a theory is an axiomatized collection of sentences has been challenged by the semantic view that a theory is a collection of nonlinguistic models and both are challenged by the view that a theory is an amorphous entity consisting perhaps of sentences and models but just as importantly of exemplars problems standards skills practices and tendencies Savage vii viii Mormann characterizes the Syntactic and Semantic Views in similar terms and is among the first to use the term Pragmatic View to capture the third view The three views are baptized via a trichotomy from linguistics deriving from the work of Charles Morris following Charles Peirce In a classic exposition the logical positivist Carnap writes If in an investigation explicit reference is made to the speaker or to put it in more general terms to the user of a language then we assign it to the field of pragmatics Whether in this case reference to designata is made or not makes no difference for this classification If we abstract from the user of the language and analyze only the expressions and their designata we are in the field of semantics And if finally we abstract from the designata also and analyze only the relations between the expressions we are in logical syntax The whole science of language consisting of the three parts mentioned is called semiotic see also Carnap To summarize syntax concerns grammar and abstract structures semantics investigates meaning and representation and pragmatics explores use Importantly while no view is oblivious to the syntax semantics or pragmatics of theory the baptism of each is a product of how one of the three aspects of language is perceived to be dominant theory as syntactic logical reconstruction Syntactic View theory as semantically meaningful mathematical modeling Semantic View or theory structure as complex and as closely tied to theory pragmatics function and context Pragmatic View Each of these philosophical perspectives on scientific theory will be reviewed in this entry Their relations will be briefly considered in the Conclusion It will be helpful to pare each perspective down to its essence Each endorses a substantive thesis about the structure of scientific theories For the Syntactic View the structure of a scientific theory is its reconstruction in terms of sentences cast in a metamathematical language Metamathematics is the axiomatic machinery for building clear foundations of mathematics and includes predicate logic set theory and model theory Zach Hacking A central question of the Syntactic View is in which logical language should we recast scientific theory Some defenders of the Semantic View keep important aspects of this reconstructive agenda moving the metamathematical apparatus from predicate logic to set theory Other advocates of the Semantic View insist that the structure of scientific theory is solely mathematical They argue that we should remain at the mathematical level rather than move up or down a level into foundations of mathematics A central question for the Semantic View is which mathematical models are actually used in science Finally for the Pragmatic View scientific theory is internally and externally complex Mathematical components while often present are neither necessary nor sufficient for characterizing the core structure of scientific theories Theory also consists of a rich variety of nonformal components analogies and natural kinds Thus the Pragmatic View argues a proper analysis of the grammar syntax and meaning semantics of theory must pay heed to scientific theory complexity as well as to the multifarious assumptions purposes values and practices informing theory A central question the Pragmatic View poses is which theory components and which modes of theorizing are present in scientific theories found across a variety of disciplines In adopting a descriptive perspective on the structure of scientific theories each view also deploys at least implicitly a prescriptive characterization of our central topic In other words postulating that scientific theory is a set theoretic structure as per Suppes also implies that what is not or could not be recast as is not or could not possibly be a scientific theory and would not help us in providing scientific understanding explanation prediction and intervention For the Syntactic View what is not or cannot be reconstructed axiomatically is not theoretical while for the Semantic View what is not or cannot be modeled mathematically is not theoretical In contrast in part due to its pluralism about what a scientific theory actually and possibly is and because it interprets theory structure as distributed in practices the Pragmatic View resists the definitional and normative terms set by the other two views As a result the Pragmatic View ultimately reforms the very concepts of theory and theory structure This encyclopedia entry will be organized as follows After presenting this piece two sustained examples immediately below the three views are reviewed in as many substantive sections Each section starts with a brief overview before characterizing that perspective account of theory structure Newtonian mechanics is used as a running example within each section The interpretation of theory structure viz how theory hooks up with phenomena experiment and the world is also reviewed in each section In the final section of this entry we turn to population genetics and an analysis of the Hardy Weinberg Principle HWP to compare and contrast each view The Conclusion suggests and remains non committal about three kinds of relations among the views identity combat and complementarity Theory is not a single static entity that we are seeing from three different perspectives as we might represent the Earth using three distinct mathematical map projections Rather theory itself changes as a consequence of perspective adopted Two examples will be used to illustrate differences between the three views Newtonian mechanics and population genetics While relativity theory is the preferred theory of the Syntactic View Newtonian mechanics is more straightforward Somewhat permissively construed the theory of Newtonian mechanics employs the basic conceptual machinery of inertial reference frames centers of mass Newton laws of motion etc to describe the dynamics and kinematics of among other phenomena point masses acting vis vis gravitational forces the solar system or with respect to forces involved in collisions pool balls on a pool table a closed container filled with gas Newtonian mechanics is explored in each section Population genetics investigates the genetic composition of populations of natural and domesticated species including the dynamics and causes of changes in gene frequencies in such populations for overviews see Lloyd Gould Pigliucci and M√ºller Okasha Population genetics emerged as a discipline with the early century work of A Fisher Sewall Wright and Haldane who synthesized Darwinian evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics One important part of population genetic theory is the Hardy Weinberg Principle HWP is a null model mathematically stating that gene frequencies remain unchanged across generations when there is no selection migration random genetic drift or other evolutionary forces acting in a given population HWP peppers early chapters of many introductory textbooks Crow and Kimura Hartl and Clark Bergstrom and Dugatkin We return to HWP in Section and here merely state questions each view might ask about population genetics The Syntactic View focuses on questions regarding the highest axiomatic level of population genetics Williams Van Valen Lewis Tuomi Examples of such queries are What would be the most convenient metamathematical axiomatization of evolutionary processes natural selection drift migration speciation competition In which formal language would and could such axiomatizations be articulated first order predicate logic set theory and category theory Which single grammars could contain a variety of deep evolutionary principles and concepts such as HWP heritability and competitive exclusion Which formal and methodological tools would permit a smooth flow from the metamathematical axiomatization to the mathematical theory of population genetics Investigations of the axiomatized rational reconstruction of theory shed light on the power and promises and weaknesses and incompleteness of the highest level theoretical edifice of population genetics Secondly the Semantic View primarily examines questions regarding the mathematical structure of population genetics Lewontin Beatty L√≥pez Beltr√°n Thompson Lloyd Very generally this exploration involves the following questions What is the form and content of the directly presented class of mathematical models of evolutionary theory HWP How could and should we organize the cluster of mathematical models sensu Levins of population genetics Which additional models diagrammatic narrative scale might be used to enrich our understanding of evolutionary theory What are the relations among theoretical mathematical models data models and experimental models How does theory explain and shape data How do the data constrain and confirm theory The main subject of investigation is mathematical structure rather than metamathematics or even alternative model types or modeling methods Finally the Pragmatic View asks about the internal complexity of population genetic theory as well as about the development and context of population genetics In so doing it inquires into how purposes and values have influenced the theoretical structure of evolutionary theory selecting and shaping current population genetics from a wide variety of possible alternative theoretical articulations The following questions about the structure of population genetic theory might be here addressed What role did A Fisher interest in animal husbandry and his tenure at Rothamsted Experimental Station play in shaping his influential methodologies of Analysis of Variance ANOVA and experimental design involving randomization blocking and factorial designs How did the development of computers and computational practices statistical techniques and the molecularization of genetics shape theory and theorizing in population genetics especially from the to today How might normative context surrounding the concept of race impact the way concepts such as heritability and lineage or principles such as HWP are deployed in population genetics As when studying an organism the structure of theory cannot be understood independently of its history and function The Syntactic View According to the Syntactic View which emerged mainly out of work of the Vienna Circle and Logical Empiricism see Coffa Friedman Creath Uebel philosophy most generally practiced is and should be the study of the logic of natural science or Wissenschaftslogik Carnap Hempel Robust and clear logical languages allow us to axiomatically reconstruct theories which by the Syntacticists definition are sets of sentences in a given logical domain language Campbell Hempel cf Carnap Theses about the Constructional System Domain languages include the language of physics the language of anthropology Carnap This view has been variously baptized as the Received View Putnam Hempel the Syntactic Approach van Fraassen the Syntactic View Wessels the Standard Conception Hempel the Orthodox View Feigl the Statement View Moulines Stegm√ºller the Axiomatic Approach van Fraassen and the Once Received View Craver For historical reasons and because of the linguistic trichotomy discussed above the Syntactic View shall be the name of choice in this entry Some conceptual taxonomy is required in order to understand the logical framework of the structure of scientific theories for the Syntactic View We shall distinguish terms sentences and languages see Table Terms Building upwards from the bottom let us start with the three kinds of terms or vocabularies contained in a scientific language theoretical logical and observational Examples of theoretical terms are molecule atom proton and protein and perhaps even macro level objects and properties such as proletariat and aggregate demand Theoretical terms or concepts can be classificatory cat or proton comparative warmer or quantitative temperature Hempel Carnap Chapter Moreover theoretical terms are theoretical constructs introduced jointly as a theoretical system Hempel Logical terms include quantifiers and connectives Predicates such as hard blue and hot and relations such as to the left of and smoother than are observational terms Sentences Terms can be strung together into three kinds of sentences theoretical correspondence and observational TS is the set of theoretical sentences that are the axioms theorems and laws of the theory Theoretical sentences include the laws of Newtonian mechanics and of the Kinetic Theory of Gases all suitably axiomatized Carnap Hempel Primitive theoretical sentences axioms can be distinguished from derivative theoretical sentences theorems see Reichenbach Hempel Feigl CS is the set of correspondence sentences tying theoretical sentences to observable phenomena or to a piece of reality Reichenbach cf Einstein To simplify they provide the theoretical syntax with an interpretation and an application a semantics Suitably axiomatized version of the following sentences provide semantics to Boyle law PV nRT in Boyle law is equivalent to the measurable volume xyz of a physical container such as a glass cube that is and centimeters in length width and height and in which the gas measured is contained and in Boyle law is equivalent to the temperature indicated on a reliable thermometer or other relevant measuring device properly calibrated attached to the physical system and read Carnap presents two examples of observational sentences OS Here in a laboratory on the surface of the earth is a pendulum of such and such a kind and the length of the pendulum is cm Importantly theoretical sentences can only contain theoretical and logical terms correspondence sentences involve all three kinds of terms and observational sentences comprise only logical and observational terms Languages The total domain language of science consists of two languages the theoretical language LT and the observational language LO Hempel Chapter Carnap Chapter the index entry for Language of Feigl Scriven and Maxwell has three subheadings observation theoretical and ordinary The theoretical language includes theoretical vocabulary while the observational language involves observational terms Both languages contain logical terms Finally the theoretical language includes and is constrained by the logical calculus Calc of the axiomatic system adopted Hempel Suppe This calculus specifies sentence grammaticality as well as appropriate deductive and non ampliative inference rules modus ponens pertinent to especially theoretical sentences Calc can itself be written in theoretical sentences Theory Structure in General Table summarizes the Syntactic View account of theory structure Table Theory Observation Term or vocabulary Theoretical logical Theoretical logical observational Observational logical The salient divide is between theory and observation Building on Table there are three different levels of scientific knowledge according to the Syntactic View TS The uninterpreted syntactic system of the scientific theory TS CS The scientific theory structure of a particular domain physics anthropology TS CS OS All of the science of a particular domain Scientific theory is thus taken to be a syntactically formulated set of theoretical sentences axioms theorems and laws together with their interpretation via correspondence sentences As we have seen theoretical sentences and correspondence sentences are cleanly distinct even if both are included in the structure of a scientific theory Open questions remain Is the observation language a sub language of the theoretical language or are they both parts of a fuller language including all the vocabulary Can the theoretical vocabulary or language be eliminated in favor of a purely observational vocabulary or language Are there other ways of carving up kinds of languages First a dialectical opposition between logic and experience form and content constitutive principles and empirical laws and from above and from below pervades the work of the syntacticists Friedman Whether syntacticists believe that a synthesis or unification of this general opposition between the theoretical logic form and the observational experience content is desirable remains a topic of ongoing discussion Regarding the second question Hempel deflates what he calls the theoretician dilemma the putative reduction without remainder of theoretical concepts and sentences to observational concepts and sentences Finally other language divisions are possible as Carnap argues see Friedman Chapter Returning to the main thread of this section the distinction toolkit of theoretical and observational terms sentences and languages Table permit the syntacticists to render theoretical structure sharply thereby aiming at the reconstructive logic of science Wissenschafstlogik that they so desire A Running Example Newtonian Mechanics Reichenbach stands as a canonical attempt by a central developer of the Syntactic View of axiomatizing a physical theory viz relativity theory cf Friedman see also Reichenbach For the purposes of this encyclopedia entry it is preferable to turn to another syntactic axiomatization effort In axiomatizing Newtonian mechanics the mid century mathematical logician Hans Hermes spent significant energy defining the concept of mass Hermes Jammer More precisely he defines the theoretical concept of mass ratio of two particles colliding inelastically in an inertial reference frame Here is his full definition of mass ratio Mass df yo Gxy VelSvty One paraphrase of this definition is the mass of is times that of is equivalent to there exists a system an instant momentary mass points and and initial velocities and such that and are genidentical respectively with and the joined mass points move with a velocity of with respect to frame immediately upon colliding at time and and have determinate velocities and before the collision in the ratio which could also be if and are themselves genidentical Hermes employs the notion of genidentical to describe the relation between two temporal sections of a given particle world line Jammer Set aside the worry that two distinct particles cannot be genidentical per Hermes definition though they can have identical properties In short this definition is syntactically complete and is written in first order predicate logic as are the other axioms and definitions in Hermes Correspondence rules connecting a postulated mass with an actual mass were not articulated by Hermes The link between theory structure and the world under the Syntactic View is contained in the theory itself CS the set of correspondence rules The term correspondence rules Margenau Nagel Carnap Chapter has a variety of near synonyms Dictionary Campbell Operational rules Bridgman Coordinative definitions Reichenbach Reduction sentences Carnap Hempel Correspondence postulates Carnap Bridge principles Hempel Kitcher Reduction functions Schaffner Bridge laws Sarkar Important differences among these terms cannot be mapped out here However in order to better understand correspondence rules two of their functions will be considered theory interpretation Carnap Hempel and ii theory reduction Nagel Schaffner The dominant perspective on correspondence rules is that they interpret theoretical terms Unlike mathematical theories the axiomatic system of physics cannot have a splendid isolation from the world Carnap Instead scientific theories require observational interpretation through correspondence rules Even so surplus meaning always remains in the theoretical structure Hempel Carnap Second correspondence rules are seen as necessary for inter theoretic reduction van Riel and Van Gulick For instance they connect observation terms such as temperature in phenomenological thermodynamics the reduced theory to theoretical concepts such as mean kinetic energy in statistical mechanics the reducing theory Correspondence rules unleash the reducing theory epistemic power Notably Nagel Chapter and Schaffner allow for multiple kinds of correspondence rules between terms of either vocabulary in the reducing and the reduced theory cf Callender Winther Dizadji Bahmani Frigg and Hartmann Correspondence rules are a core part of the structure of scientific theories and serve as glue between theory and observation Finally while they are not part of the theory structure and although we saw some examples above observation sentences are worth briefly reviewing Correspondence rules attach to the content of observational sentences Observational sentences were analyzed as protocol sentences or Protokolls√§tze Schlick Carnap cf Neurath and as ii experimental laws Campbell Nagel Carnap cf Duhem Although constrained by Calc the grammar of these sentences is determined primarily by the order of nature as it were In general syntacticists do not consider methods of data acquisition experiment and measurement to be philosophically interesting In contrast the confirmation relation between collected data and theory especially as developed in inductive logic Reichenbach Carnap as well as questions about the conventionality grammaticality foundationalism atomism and content of sense data and synthetic statements are considered philosophically important Carnap Neurath Reichenbach Schlick for contemporary commentary see Creath Rutte Friedman Taking Stock Syntactic View To summarize the Syntactic View holds that there are three kinds of terms or vocabularies logical theoretical and observational three kinds of sentences TS CS and OS and two languages LT and LO Moreover the structure of scientific theories could be analyzed using the logical tools of metamathematics The goal is to reconstruct the logic of science viz to articulate an axiomatic system Interestingly this perspective has able and active defenders today who discuss constitutive and axiomatized principles of the historical relativized a priori Friedman cf argue that the semantic view if plausible is syntactic Halvorson and explore logicism for and in the philosophy of science Demopulous van Benthem Furthermore for purposes of the syntactic reconstruction of scientific theories some continue espousing or perhaps plea for the resurrection of predicate logic Lutz while other contemporary syntacticists Halvorson endorse more recently developed metamathematical and mathematical equipment such as category theory which turns out to be a kind of universal mathematical language like set theory Awodey see Eilenberg and MacLane Classical syntacticists such as Rudolf Carnap Friedman Carus Koellner ms in Other Internet Resources and Joseph Henry Woodger Nicholson and Gawne have recently received increasing attention The Semantic View An overarching theme of the Semantic View is that analyzing theory structure requires employing mathematical tools rather than predicate logic After all defining scientific concepts within a specific formal language makes any axiomatizing effort dependent on the choice nature and idiosyncrasies of that narrowly defined language For instance Suppes understands first order predicate logic with its linguistic rather than set theoretical entities as utterly impractical for the formalization of theories with more complicated structures like probability theory Suppes cf Suppes Van Fraassen another influential defender of the Semantic View believes that the logical apparatus of the Syntactic View had moved us mille milles de toute habitation scientifique isolated in our own abstract dreams van Fraassen Indeed what would the appropriate logical language for specific mathematical structures be especially when such structures could be reconstructed in a variety of formal languages Why should we imprison mathematics and mathematical scientific theory in syntactically defined language when we could instead directly investigate the mathematical objects relations and functions of scientific theory Consistent with the combat strategy discussed in the Conclusion here is a list of grievances against the Syntactic View discussed at length in the work of some semanticists First Order Predicate Logic Objection Theoretical structure is intrinsically and invariably tied to the specific choice of a language LT expressed in first order predicate logic This places heavy explanatory and representational responsibility on relatively inflexible and limited languages Theory Individuation Objection Since theories are individuated by their linguistic formulations every change in high level syntactic formulations will bring forth a distinct theory This produces a reductio if and then and though logically equivalent have different syntactic formulations and would be distinct theories Theoretical Observational Languages Objection Drawing the theoretical observational distinction in terms of language is inappropriate as observability pertains to entities rather than to concepts Unintended Models Objection There is no clear way of distinguishing between intended and unintended models for syntactically characterized theories the L√∂wenheim Skolem theorem Bays Confused Correspondence Rules Objection Correspondence rules are a confused medley of direct meaning relationships between terms and world means of inter theoretic reduction causal relationship claims and manners of theoretical concept testing Trivially True yet Non Useful Objection Presenting scientific theory in a limited axiomatic system while clearly syntactically correct is neither useful nor honest since scientific theories are mathematical structures Practice and History Ignored Objection Syntactic approaches do not pay sufficient attention to the actual practice and history of scientific theorizing and experimenting What then does the Semantic View propose to put in the Syntactic View place Even a minimal description of the Semantic View must acknowledge two distinct strategies of characterizing and comprehending theory structure the state space and the set model theoretic approaches The State Space Approach The state space approach emphasizes the mathematical models of actual science and draws a clear line between mathematics and metamathematics The structure of a scientific theory is identified with the class family or cluster of mathematical models constituting it rather than with any metamathematical axioms yoked to a particular syntax van Fraassen Under this analysis the correct tool for philosophy of science is mathematics not metamathematics this is Suppes slogan per van Fraassen In particular a state space or phase space is an dimensional space where each of the relevant variables of a theory correspond to a single dimension and each point in that space represents a possible state of a real system An actual real system can take on and change states according to different kinds of laws viz laws of succession determining possible trajectories through that space Newtonian kinematic laws laws of co existence specifying the permitted regions of the total space Boyle law and laws of interaction combining multiple laws of succession or co existence or both population genetic models combining laws of succession for selection and genetic drift Wright Lloyd Rice Clatterbuck Sober and Lewontin Different models of a given theory will share some dimensions of their state space while differing in others Such models will also partially overlap in laws for further discussion of state spaces laws and models pertinent to the Semantic View see Suppe Lloyd Chapter Nolte Weisberg Historically the state space approach emerged from work by Evert Beth John von Neumann and Hermann Weyl and has important parallels with Prze≈Çƒôcki and Dalla Chiara Scabia and Toraldo di Francia on the history of the approach see Suppe van Fraassen Lorenzano advocates of the approach include Beatty Giere Giere Bickle and Mauldin Lloyd In Press Suppe Thompson van Fraassen for alternative early analyses of models see Braithwaite Hesse Interestingly van Fraassen provides a potential reconstruction of state spaces via an analysis of semi interpreted languages Weisberg building on many insights from Giere work presents a broad view of modeling that includes mathematical structures that are trajectories in state spaces but also permits concrete objects and computational structures such as algorithms to be deemed models Lorenzano calls Giere and by extension Weisberg and even Godfrey Smith approach model based separating it out from the state space approach A more fine grained classification of the state space approach is desirable particularly if we wish to understand important lessons stemming from the Pragmatic View of Theories as we shall see below As an example of a state space analysis of modeling consider a capsule traveling in outer space An empirically and dynamically adequate mathematical model of the capsule behavior would capture the position of the capsule three dimensions of the formal state space as well as the velocity and acceleration vectors for each of the three standard spatial dimensions six more dimensions in the formal state space If the mass were unknown or permitted to vary we would have to add one more dimension Possible and actual trajectories of our capsule with known mass within this abstract dimensional state space could be inferred via Newtonian dynamical laws of motion example in Lewontin consult Suppe Importantly under the state space approach the interesting philosophical work of characterizing theory structure as classes of models theory meaning data models mapped to theoretical models and theory function explaining and predicting happens at the level of mathematical models The Set Model Theoretic Approach Lurking in the background of the state space conception is the fact that mathematics actually includes set theory and model theory mathematical logic Indeed according to some interlocutors metamathematics is part of mathematics Halvorson Historically a set model theoretic approach emerged from Tarski work and was extensively articulated by Suppes and his associates van Fraassen Set theory is a general language for formalizing mathematical structures as collections sets of abstract objects which can themselves be relations or functions see Krivine Model theory investigates the relations between on the one hand the formal axioms theorems and laws of a particular theory and on the other hand the mathematical structures the models that provide an interpretation of that theory or put differently that make the theory axioms theorems and laws true Hodges Chapter Jones Interestingly model theory often uses set theory Marker set theory can in turn be extended to link axiomatic theories and semantic models via set theoretical predicates Suppes Finally there are certain hybrids of these two branches of mathematical logic including partial structures da Costa and French Bueno French and Ladyman Vickers Bueno French and Ladyman Lorenzano provides a more complex taxonomy of the intellectual landscape of the Semantic View including a discussion of Structuralism a kind of set model theoretic perspective Structuralism involves theses about theory nets theory relative theoretical vs non theoretical terms a diversity of intra and inter theoretic laws with different degrees of generality a typology of inter theoretic relations and a rich account of correspondence rules in scientific practice see Moulines Pereda Schmidt Ladyman On the whole the set model theoretic approach of the Semantic View insists on the inseparability of metamathematics and mathematics In preferring to characterize a theory axiomatically in terms of its intension rather than its extension it shares the Syntactic View aims of reconstructive axiomatization Sneed Stegm√ºller Frigg and Votsis Halvorson Lutz An example will help motivate the relation between theory and model Two qualifications are required we return to a more standard set model theoretic illustration below viz McKinsey Sugar and Suppes axiomatization of particle mechanics and ii this motivational example is not from the heartland of model theory see Hodges Following van Fraassen intuitive case of seven point geometry also known as the Fano plane we see how a particular geometric figure the model interprets and makes true a set of axioms and theorems the theory In topology and geometry there is rich background theory regarding how to close Euclidean planes and spaces to make finite geometries by for instance eliminating parallel lines Consider the axioms of a projective plane For any two points exactly one line lies on both For any two lines exactly one point lies on both There exists a set of four points such that no line has more than two of them A figure of a geometric model that makes this theory true is This is the smallest geometrical model satisfying the three axioms of the projective plane theory Indeed this example fits van Fraassen succinct characterization of the theory model relation A model is called a model of a theory exactly if the theory is entirely true if considered with respect to this model alone Figuratively the theory would be true if this model was the whole world That is if the entire universe consisted solely of these seven points and seven lines the projective plane theory would be true Of course our universe is bigger Because Euclidean geometry includes parallel lines the Fano plane is not a model of Euclidean geometry Even so by drawing the plane we have shown it to be isomorphic to parts of the Euclidean plane In other words the Fano plane has been embedded in a Euclidean plane Below we return to the concepts of embedding and isomorphism but this example shall suffice for now to indicate how a geometric model can provide a semantics for the axioms of a theory In short for the Semantic View the structure of a scientific theory is its class of mathematical models According to some advocates of this view the family of models can itself be axiomatized with those very models or other models serving as axiom truth makers Returning to our running example consider Suppes model theoretic articulation of particle mechanics which builds on his article with McKinsey and A Sugar Under this analysis there is a domain of set theoretic objects of the form where and are themselves sets and are binary functions is a unary and a ternary function is the set of particles is a set of real numbers measuring elapsed times is the position of particle at time is the mass of particle is the force particle exerts on at time and is the total resultant force by all other particles on at time Suppes and his collaborators defined seven axioms three kinematical and four dynamical characterizing Newtonian particle mechanics see also Simon Such axioms include Newton third law reconstructed in set theoretic formulation thus Suppes For in and in Importantly the set theoretic objects are found in more than one of the axioms of the theory and Newton calculus is reconstructed in a novel set theoretic form Set theoretic predicates such as is a binary relation and is a function are also involved in axiomatizing particle mechanics Suppes Once these axioms are made explicit their models can be specified and these can in turn be applied to actual systems thereby providing a semantics for the axioms as described in Section below A particular system satisfying these seven axioms is a particle mechanics system For an example of Newtonian mechanics from the state space approach recall the space capsule of Section Interpreting Theory Structure per the Semantic View How is the theory structure described in Section applied to empirical phenomena How do we connect theory and data via observation and experimental and measuring techniques The Semantic View distinguishes theory individuation from both theory phenomena and theory world relations Three types of analysis of theory interpretation are worth investigating a hierarchy of models Suppes Suppe ii similarity Giere Weisberg and iii isomorphism van Fraassen French and Ladyman A Hierarchy of Models One way of analyzing theory structure interpretation is through a series of models falling under the highest level axiomatizations This series has been called a hierarchy of models though it need not be considered a nested hierarchy These models include models of theory models of experiment and models of data Suppes Here is a summary of important parts of the hierarchy Suppes Table cf Giere Figure Axioms of Theory Axioms define set theoretic predicates and constitute the core structure of scientific theories as reviewed in Section Models of Theory Representation Theorems permit us to discover if an interesting subset of models for the theory may be found such that any model for the theory is isomorphic to some member of this subset Suppes Representation theorem methodology can be extended down the hierarchy both to models of experiment and models of data and ii from isomorphism to homomorphism Suppes ff Suppe Cartwright Models of Experiment Criteria of experimental design motivate choices for how to set up and analyze experiments There are complex mappings between models of experiment thus specified and models of theory ii theories of measurement and iii models of data Models of Data In building models of data phenomena are organized with respect to statistical goodness of fit tests and parameter estimation in the context of models of theory Choices about which parameters to represent must be made The temptation to place phenomena at the bottom of the hierarchy must be resisted because phenomena permeate all levels Indeed the class of phenomena pertinent to a scientific theory is its intended scope Suppe Weisberg Furthermore this temptation raises fundamental questions about scientific representation there is the more profound issue of the relationship between the lower most representation in the hierarchy the data model perhaps and reality itself but of course this is hardly something that the semantic approach alone can be expected to address French and Ladyman cf van Fraassen The link to reality Borrowing from David Chalmers the hard problem of philosophy of science remains connecting abstract structures to concrete phenomena data and world Similarity The similarity analysis of theory interpretation combines semantic and pragmatic dimensions Giere Giere Bickle and Mauldin Weisberg According to Giere interpretation is mediated by theoretical hypotheses positing representational relations between a model and relevant parts of the world Such relations may be stated as follows uses to represent for purposes Here is a scientist research group or community is a part of the world and is broadly speaking any one of a variety of models Giere Model world similarity judgments are conventional and intentional Note that I am not saying that the model itself represents an aspect of the world because it is similar to that aspect Anything is similar to anything else in countless respects but not anything represents anything else It is not the model that is doing the representing it is the scientist using the model who is doing the representing Relatedly Weisberg draws upon Tversky to develop a similarity metric for model interpretation equation This metric combines model target semantics and ii the pragmatics of context conceptualization of the target and the theoretical goals of the scientist Giere and Weisberg thus endorse an abundance of adequate mapping relations between a given model and the world From this diversity scientists and scientific communities must select particularly useful similarity relationships for contextual modeling purposes Because of semantic pluralism and irreducible intentionality this similarity analysis of theory interpretation cannot be accommodated within a hierarchy of models approach interpreted as a neat model nesting based on pre given semantic relations among models at different levels Isomorphism The term isomorphism is a composite of the Greek words for equal and shape or form Indeed in mathematics isomorphism is a perfect one to one bijective mapping between two structures or sets Figure literally and figuratively captures the term Especially in set theory category theory algebra and topology there are various kinds of morphisms viz of mapping relations between two structures or models Figure indicates five different kinds of homomorphism arranged in a Venn diagram Although philosophers have focused on isomorphism other morphisms such as monomorphism an injective homomorphism where some elements in the co domain remain unmapped from the domain might also be interesting to investigate especially for embedding data the domain into rich theoretical structures the co domain To complete the visualization above an epimorphism is a surjective homomorphism and an endomorphism is a mapping from a structure to itself although it need not be a symmetrical invertible mapping which would be an automorph Perhaps the most avid supporter of isomorphism and embedding as the way to understand theory interpretation is van Fraassen In a nutshell if we distinguish theoretical models ii empirical substructures van Fraassen alternatively surface models and iii observable phenomena then van Fraassen argues theory interpretation is a relation of isomorphism between observable phenomena and empirical substructures which are themselves isomorphic with one or more theoretical models Moreover if a relation of isomorphism holds between and a richer we say that we have embedded in For instance with respect to the seven point geometry above Figure van Fraassen contends that isomorphism gives embeddability and that the relation of isomorphism is important because it is also the exact relation a phenomenon bears to some model or theory if that theory is empirically adequate this kind of statement seems to be simultaneously descriptive and prescriptive about scientific representation see Section above In The Scientific Image he is even clearer about fleshing out the empirical adequacy of a theory with its theoretical models in terms of isomorphism between appearances the structures which can be described in experimental and measurement reports italics removed and empirical substructures Speaking metaphorically the phenomena are from a theoretical point of view small arbitrary and chaotic even nasty brutish and short but can be understood as embeddable in beautifully simple but much larger mathematical models see also van Fraassen and Interestingly and as a defender of an identity strategy see Conclusion Friedman also appeals to embedding and subsumption relations between theory and phenomena in his analyses of theory interpretation Friedman see Winther Bueno da Costa French and Ladyman also employ embedding and partial isomorphism in the empirical interpretation of partial structures Bueno Bueno French and Ladyman da Costa and French French and Ladyman Ladyman Su√°rez discusses complexities in van Fraassen analyses of scientific representation and theory interpretation Su√°rez On the one hand representation is structural identity between the theoretical and the empirical On the other hand There is no representation except in the sense that some things are used made or taken to represent some things as thus or so van Fraassen italics removed The reader interested in learning how van Fraassen simultaneously endorses acontextually structural and contextually pragmatic aspects of representation and interpretation should refer to van Fraassen investigations of maps and the essential indexical To complement the structure vs function distinction see van Fraassen for a structure structural relations vs history the intellectual processes that lead to those models distinction cf Ladyman et al In all of this embedding via isomorphism is a clear contender for theory interpretation under the Semantic View Taking Stock Semantic View In short committing to either a state space or a set model theoretic view on theory structure does not imply any particular perspective on theory interpretation hierarchy of models similarity embedding Instead commitments to the former are logically and actually separable from positions on the latter Suppes and Suppe endorse different accounts of theory structure but share an understanding of theory interpretation in terms of a hierarchy of models The Semantic View is alive and well as a family of analyses of theory structure and continues to be developed in interesting ways both in its state space and set model theoretic approaches The Pragmatic View The Pragmatic View recognizes that a number of assumptions about scientific theory seem to be shared by the Syntactic and Semantic Views Both perspectives agree very roughly that theory is explicit mathematical abstract systematic readily individualizable distinct from data and experiment and highly explanatory and predictive see Flyvbjerg cf Dreyfus The Pragmatic View imagines the structure of scientific theories rather differently arguing for a variety of theses Limitations Idealized theory structure might be too weak to ground the predictive and explanatory work syntacticists and semanticists expect of it Cartwright Morgan and Morrison Su√°rez and Cartwright Pluralism Theory structure is plural and complex both in the sense of internal variegation and of existing in many types In other words there is an internal pluralism of theory and model components mathematical concepts metaphors analogies ontological assumptions values natural kinds and classifications distinctions and policy views Kuhn Boumans as well as a broad external pluralism of different types of theory and models operative in science mechanistic historical and mathematical models Hacking Longino Winther Indeed it may be better to speak of the structures of scientific theories in the double plural Nonformal aspects The internal pluralism of theory structure thesis includes many nonformal aspects deserving attention That is many components of theory structure such as metaphors analogies values and policy views have a non mathematical and informal nature and they lie implicit or hidden Bailer Jones Craver Contessa Winther Morgan Interestingly the common understanding of formal which identifies formalization with mathematization may itself be a conceptual straightjacket the term could be broadened to include diagram abstraction and principle extraction Griesemer who explicitly endorses what he also calls a Pragmatic View of Theories Function Characterizations of the nature and dynamics of theory structure should pay attention to the user as well as to purposes and values Apostel Minsky Morrison Winther Practice Theory structure is continuous with practice and the experimental life making it difficult to neatly dichotomize theory and practice Hacking Shapin and Schaffer Galison Su√°rez and Cartwright These are core commitments of the Pragmatic View It is important to note at the outset that the Pragmatic View takes its name from the linguistic trichotomy discussed above in the Introduction This perspective need not imply commitment to or association with American Pragmatism the work of Charles Peirce William James or John Dewey cf Hookway Richardson For instance Hacking distinguishes his pragmatic attitudes from the school of Pragmatism He maps out alternative historical routes of influence in general and on him vis vis fallibilism via Imre Lakatos Karl Popper Hacking historically conditioned truthfulness via Bernard Williams Hacking and realism as intervening via Francis Everitt Melissa Franklin Hacking To borrow a term from phylogenetics the Pragmatic View is polyphyletic The components of its analytical framework have multiple independent origins some of which circumnavigate American Pragmatism With this qualification and the five theses above in mind let us now turn to the Pragmatic View analysis of theory structure and theory interpretation We should distinguish two strands of the Pragmatic View the Pragmatic View of Models and a proper Pragmatic View of Theories The Pragmatic View of Models Nancy Cartwright How the Laws of Physics Lie crystallized the Pragmatic View of Models Under Cartwright analysis models are the appropriate level of investigation for philosophers trying to understand science She argues for significant limitations of theory thesis claiming that laws of nature are rarely true and are epistemically weak Theory as a collection of laws cannot therefore support the many kinds of inferences and explanations that we have come to expect it to license Cartwright urges us to turn to models and modeling which are central to scientific practice Moreover models lie figuratively and literally between theory and the world cf Derman That is to explain a phenomenon is to find a model that fits it into the basic framework of the theory and that thus allows us to derive analogues for the messy and complicated phenomenological laws which are true of it A plurality of models exist and models serve a variety of purposes Cartwright cf Suppes Cartwright is interested in the practices and purposes of scientific models and asks us to focus on models rather than theories Cartwright insights into model pluralism and model practices stand as a significant contribution of The Stanford School cf Cat and were further developed by the models as mediators group with participants at LSE University of Amsterdam and University of Toronto Morgan and Morrison Chang cf Mart√≠nez This group insisted on the internal pluralism of model components thesis According to Morgan and Morrison building a model involves fitting together bits which come from disparate sources including stories Morgan and Morrison Boumans writes model building is like baking a cake without a recipe The ingredients are theoretical ideas policy views mathematisations of the cycle metaphors and empirical facts Mathematical moulding is shaping the ingredients in such a mathematical form that integration is possible In an instructive diagram Boumans suggests that a variety of factors besides theory and data feed into a model metaphors analogies policy views stylised facts mathematical techniques and mathematical concepts The full range of components involved in a model will likely vary according to discipline and with respect to explanations and interventions sought analogies but not policy views will be important in theoretical physics In short model building involves a complex variety of internal nonformal aspects some of which are implicit theses and As one example of a nonformal component of model construction and model structure consider metaphors and analogies Bailer Jones Geary states the simplest equation of metaphor thus following Aristotle Metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else Poetics The line between metaphor and analogy in science is blurry Some interlocutors synonymize them Hoffman Brown others reduce one to the other analogy is a form of metaphor Geary metaphor is a kind of analogy Gentner and yet others bracket one to focus on the other Oppenheimer sets aside metaphor One way to distinguish them is to reserve analogy for concrete comparisons with clearly identifiable and demarcated source and target domains and with specific histories and use metaphor for much broader and indeterminate comparisons with diffuse trajectories across discourses Analogies include the lines of force of electricity and magnetism Maxwell and Faraday the atom as a planetary system Rutherford and Bohr the benzene ring as a snake biting its own tail Kekul√© Darwin natural selection and entangled bank and behavioral drives Tinbergen Hesse Bartha Examples of metaphor are genetic information superorganism and networks Keller More could be said about other informal model components but this discussion of metaphors and analogies shall suffice to hint at how models do not merely lie between theory and world Models express a rich internal pluralism see also de Chadarevian and Hopwood Morgan Model complexity can also be seen in the external plurality of models thesis Not all models are mathematical or even ideally recast as mathematical Non formalized non state space non set model theoretic models such as physical diagrammatic material historical remnant and fictional models are ubiquitous across the sciences Frigg and Hartmann for the biological sciences see Hull Beatty Griesemer a Downes Richards Winther Leonelli Weisberg Moreover computer simulations differ in important respects from more standard analytical mathematical models Smith Winsberg Weisberg According to some Griesemer Downes Godfrey Smith Thomson Jones this diversity belies claims by semanticists that models can always be cast into set theoretic terms Lloyd In Press are always a mathematical structure van Fraassen or that formalisation of a theory is an abstract representation of the theory expressed in a formal deductive framework in first order predicate logic with identity in set theory in matrix algebra and indeed any branch of mathematics Thompson Even so internal pluralism has been interpreted as supporting a deflationary semantic view which is minimally committed to the perspective that model construction is an important part of scientific theorizing Downes Given the formal and mathematical framework of the Semantic View see above however the broad plurality of kinds of models seems to properly belong under a Pragmatic View of Models The Pragmatic View of Theories Interestingly while critiquing the Syntactic and Semantic Views on most matters the Pragmatic View of Models construed theory the process of theorizing and the structure of scientific theories according to terms set by the two earlier views For instance Cartwright tends to conceive of theory as explicit mathematical abstract and so forth see the first paragraph of Section She always resisted the traditional syntactic semantic view of theory for its vending machine view in which a theory is a deductive and automated machine that upon receiving empirical input gurgitates and then drops out the sought for representation Rather than reform Syntactic and Semantic accounts of theory and theory structure however she invites us as we just saw to think of science as modeling with theory as one small component Cartwright Shomar and Su√°rez Su√°rez and Cartwright Many have followed her Kitcher predilection is also to accept the terms of the Syntactic and Semantic Views For instance he defines theories as axiomatic deductive systems In a strategy complementary to Cartwright modeling turn Kitcher encourages us to focus on practice including practices of modeling and even practices of theorizing In The Advancement of Science practice is analyzed as a tuple with the following highly abbreviated components a language ii questions iii statements pictures diagrams iv explanatory patterns standard examples vi paradigms of experimentation and observation plus instruments and tools and vii methodology Kitcher Scientific practice is also center stage for those singing the praises of the experimental life Hacking Shapin and Schaffer Galison and those highlighting the cognitive grounds of science Giere Mart√≠nez and science social and normative context Kitcher Longino Ziman cf Simon Indeed the modeling and practice turns in the philosophy of science were reasonable reactions to the power of axiomatic reconstructive and mathematical modeling analyses of the structure of scientific theories Yet a Pragmatic View of Theories is also afoot one resisting orthodox characterizations of theory often embraced at least early on by Pragmatic View philosophers such as Cartwright Hacking Kitcher and Longino For instance Craver accepts both the Syntactic and Semantic Views which he humorously and not inaccurately calls the Once Received View and the Model Model View But he also observes While these analyses have advanced our understanding of some formal aspects of theories and their uses they have neglected or obscured those aspects dependent upon nonformal patterns in theories Progress can be made in understanding scientific theories by attending to their diverse nonformal patterns and by identifying the axes along which such patterns might differ from one another Craver then turns to mechanistic theory as a third theory type and a third philosophical analysis of theory structure that highlights nonformal patterns Different types of mechanisms can be distinguished on the basis of recurrent patterns in their organization Mechanisms may be organized in series in parallel or in cycles They may contain branches and joins and they often include feedback and feedforward subcomponents Consistent with theses and of the Pragmatic View we must recognize the internal pluralism of theories as including nonformal components Some of these are used to represent organizational and compositional relations of complex systems Winther Wimsatt Walsh forthcoming While mechanistic analyses such as Craver may not wish to follow every aspect of the Pragmatic View of Theories there are important and deep resonances between the two In a review of da Costa and French Contessa writes Philosophers of science are increasingly realizing that the differences between the syntactic and the semantic view are less significant than semanticists would have it and that ultimately neither is a suitable framework within which to think about scientific theories and models The crucial divide in philosophy of science I think is not the one between advocates of the syntactic view and advocates of the semantic view but the one between those who think that philosophy of science needs a formal framework or other and those who think otherwise Again we are invited to develop a non formal framework of science and presumably also of scientific theory Halvorson takes Contessa to task for advocating informal philosophy of science Moreover in asking what should the content of a given theory be taken to be on a given occasion Vickers answers It seems clear that in addition to theories being vague objects in the way that heaps of sand are there will be fundamentally different ways to put together theoretical assumptions depending on the particular investigation one is undertaking For example sometimes it will be more appropriate to focus on the assumptions which were used by scientists rather than the ones that were believed to be true footnote suppressed A Pragmatic View of Theories helps make explicit nonformal internal components of theory structure Key early defenders of the modeling and practice turns have also recently begun to envision theory in a way distinct from the terms set by the Syntactic and Semantic Views Su√°rez and Cartwright extend and distribute theory by arguing that What we know theoretically is recorded in a vast number of places in a vast number of different ways not just in words and formulae but in machines techniques experiments and applications as well And while her influence lies primarily in the modeling turn even in characterizing the vending machine view Cartwright calls for a reasonable philosophical account of theories that is much more textured and much more laborious than that adopted by the Syntactic and Semantic Views The theory data and theory world axes need to be rethought Kitcher wishes to transform talk of theories into discussion of significance graphs ff These are network diagrams illustrating which and how questions are considered significant in the context of particular scientific communities and norms cf Brown Consistently with a Pragmatic View of Theories Morrison reconsiders and reforms canonical conceptualizations of theory Finally Longino proposes an archaeology of assumptions behind and under different research programs and theories of human behavior such as neurobiological molecular behavioral genetic and social environmental approaches Oyama For instance two shared or recurring assumptions across programs and theories are that the approach in question has methods of measuring both the behavioral outcome that is the object of investigation and the factors whose association with it are the topic of investigation and that the resulting measurements are exportable beyond the confines of the approach within which they are made Longino A Pragmatic View of Theories expands the notion of theory to include nonformal aspects which surely must include elements from Boumans list above metaphors analogies policy views as well as more standard components such as ontological assumptions Kuhn Levins and Lewontin Winther natural kinds Hacking and conditions of application or scope Longino In addition to exploring internal theory diversity and in parallel with plurality of modeling a Pragmatic View of Theories could also explore pluralism of modes of theorizing and of philosophically analyzing theoretical structure thesis Craver provides a start in this direction in that he accepts three kinds of scientific theory and of philosophical analysis of scientific theory A more synoptic view of the broader pragmatic context in which theories are embedded can be found in the literature on different styles of scientific reasoning and theorizing Crombie Vicedo Pickstone Davidson Hacking Winther Elwick Mancosu While there is no univocal or dominant classification of styles two lessons are important First a rough consensus exists that theoretical investigations of especially historical mechanistic and mathematical structures and relations will involve different styles Second each style integrates theoretical products and theorizing processes in unique ways thus inviting an irreducible pragmatic methodological pluralism in our philosophical analysis of the structure of scientific theories For instance the structure of theories of mechanisms in molecular biology or neuroscience involves flow charts Craver and is distinct from the structure of theories of historical processes and patterns as found in systematics and phylogenetics which involves phylogenetic trees Winther As Crombie suggests we need a comparative historical anthropology of thinking see Hacking Mathematical theory hardly remains regnant It gives way to a pluralism of theory forms and theory processes Indeed even mathematical theorizing is a pluralistic motley as Hacking argues Although a deflationary Semantic View could account for pluralism of theory forms the Pragmatic View of Theories drawing on styles is required to do justice to the immense variety of theorizing processes and of philosophical accounts of theory and theory structure Finally outstanding work remains in sorting out the philosophical utility of a variety of proposed units in addition to styles such as Kuhn paradigms Lakatos research programmes Laudan research traditions and Holton themata A rational comparative historical anthropology of both theorizing and philosophical analyses of theorizing remains mostly unmapped cf Matheson and Dallmann Such a comparative meta philosophical analysis should also address Davidson worries about conceptual schemes and Popper critique of the myth of the framework see Hacking Godfrey Smith A Running Example Newtonian Mechanics Cartwright has done much to develop a Pragmatic View Start by considering Newton second law ma Here is the resultant force on a mass and a is the net acceleration of both and a are vectors This law is considered a general Cartwright law expressed with abstract quantities Cartwright Newton second law can be complemented with other laws such as Hooke law for an ideal spring kx Here is the force constant of the spring and the distance along the axis from the equilibrium position and ii Coulomb law modeling the force between two charged particles Here is Coulomb electrical constant and are the charges of the two objects and the distance between the two objects The picture Cartwright draws for us is that Newton Hooke and Coulomb laws are abstract leaving out many details They can be used to derive mathematical models of concrete systems For instance by combining and the law of gravitation a fundamental law Cartwright other source laws and various simplifying assumptions we might create a model for the orbit of Mars treating the Sun and Mars as a body system ignoring the other planets asteroids and Mars moons Indeed the Solar System is a powerful nomological machine Cartwright which is a fixed enough arrangement of components or factors with stable enough capacities that in the right sort of stable enough environment will with repeated operation give rise to the kind of regular behaviour that we represent in our scientific laws Cartwright Importantly most natural systems are complex and irregular and cannot be neatly characterized as nomological machines For these cases abstract laws run out Cartwright and are rarely smoothly deidealised Su√°rez In general abstract laws predict and explain only within a given domain of application and only under ideal conditions More concrete laws or models are not directly deduced from them Su√°rez Su√°rez and Cartwright and they can rarely be combined to form effective super laws Cartwright In short the move from and or from and to appropriate phenomenological models is not fully specified by either abstract law pairing Indeed Cartwright developed her notion of capacities to discuss how the principles of physics are far better rendered as claims about capacities capacities that can be assembled and reassembled in different nomological machines unending in their variety to give rise to different laws Articulating concrete models requires integrating a mix of mathematical and nonformal components Laws and remain only one component among many of the models useful for exploring the behavior of the Solar System balls on a pool table or the behavior of charges in electrical fields Shifting examples but not philosophical research program Su√°rez and Cartwright explains how analogies such as superconductors as diamagnets as opposed to ferromagnets were an integral part of the mathematical model of superconductivity developed by Fritz and Heinz London in the cf London and London Su√°rez and Cartwright gladly accept that this model is uncontroversially grounded in classic electromagnetic theory However contra Semantic View Structuralists such as Bueno da Costa French and Ladyman they view nonformal aspects as essential to practices of scientific modeling and theorizing The analogy of diamagnets helps us to understand how the Londons work with their model which assumptions they add and which not a formal reconstruction of the model on its own cannot help us to understand that In short the running example of Newtonian mechanics in conjunction with a glimpse into the use of analogies in mathematical modeling illustrates the Pragmatic View account of theory syntax theory is constituted by a plurality of formal and informal components Interpreting Theory Structure per the Pragmatic View As we have explored throughout this section models and theories have informal internal components and there are distinct modes of modeling and theorizing Because of the Pragmatic View attention to practice function and application distinguishing structure from interpretation is more difficult here than under the Syntactic and Semantic Views Any synchronic analysis of the structure of models and theories must respect intentional diachronic processes of interpreting and using as we shall now see Regarding the import of function in models and theories thesis already the Belgian philosopher of science Apostel defined modeling thus Let then indicate the main variables of the modelling relationship The subject takes in view of the purpose the entity as a model for the prototype see also Apostel Purposes took center stage in his article title Towards the Formal Study of Models in the Non Formal Sciences MIT Artificial Intelligence trailblazer Minsky also provided a pragmatic analysis We use the term model in the following sense To an observer an object A is a model of an object A to the extent that can use A to answer questions that interest him about A The model relation is inherently ternary Any attempt to suppress the role of the intentions of the investigator leads to circular definitions or to ambiguities about essential features and the like This account is thoroughly intentionalist and anti essentialist That is mapping relations between model and world are left open and overdetermined Specifying the relevant relations depends on contextual factors such as questions asked and the kinds of similarities and isomorphisms deemed to be of interest The appropriate relations are selected from an infinite or at least near infinite variety of possible relations Rosenblueth and Wiener Lowry Winther forthcoming Regarding practice thesis in addition to ample work on the experimental life mentioned above consider a small example A full understanding of the content and structure of the London brothers model of superconductivity requires attention to informal aspects such as analogies Even London and London state in the summary of their paper that the current in a supraconductor is characterized as a kind of diamagnetic volume current They too saw the diamagnetic analogy as central to their theoretical practices Criteria and practices of theory confirmation also differ from the ones typical of the Syntactic and Semantic Views While predictive and explanatory power as well as empirical adequacy remain important the Pragmatic View also insists on a variety of other justificatory criteria including pragmatic virtues sensu Kuhn Longino such as fruitfulness and utility In a nutshell the Pragmatic View argues that scientific theory structure is deeply shaped and constrained by functions and practices and that theory can be interpreted and applied validly according to many different criteria Taking Stock Pragmatic View The analytical framework of the Pragmatic View remains under construction The emphasis is on internal diversity and on the external pluralism of models and theories of modeling and theorizing and of philosophical analyses of scientific theories The Pragmatic View acknowledges that scientists use and need different kinds of theories for a variety of purposes There is no one size fits all structure of scientific theories Notably although the Pragmatic View does not necessarily endorse the views of the tradition of American Pragmatism it has important resonances with the latter school emphasis on truth and knowledge as processual purposive pluralist and context dependent and on the social and cognitive structure of scientific inquiry A further qualification in addition to the one above regarding American Pragmatism is in order The Pragmatic View has important precursors in the historicist or world view perspectives of Feyerabend Hanson Kuhn and Toulmin which were an influential set of critiques of the Syntactic View utterly distinct from the Semantic View This philosophical tradition focused on themes such as meaning change and incommensurability of terms across world views paradigms scientific change revolutionary Kuhn evolutionary Toulmin the interweaving of context of discovery and context of justification and scientific rationality Preston Bird Swoyer The historicists also opposed the idea that theories can secure meaning and empirical support from a theory neutral and purely observational source as the Syntactic View had insisted on with its strong distinction between theoretical and observational vocabularies cf Galison Kuhn paradigms or more precisely disciplinary matrices even had an internal anatomy with four components laws or symbolic generalizations ii ontological assumptions iii values and iv exemplars Kuhn postscript Godfrey Smith Hacking This work was concerned more with theory change than with theory structure and had fewer conceptual resources from sociology of science and history of science than contemporary Pragmatic View work Moreover paradigms never quite caught on the way analyses of models and modeling have Even so this work did much to convince later scholars including many of the Pragmatic View of certain weaknesses in understanding theories as deductive axiomatic structures Population Genetics As a final way to contrast the three views we return to population genetics and especially to the Hardy Weinberg Principle HWP Both Woodger and Williams provide detailed axiomatizations of certain parts of biology especially genetics developmental biology and phylogenetics For instance Woodger constructs an axiomatic system based on ten logical predicates or relations including part of before in time reproduced by cell division or cell fusion male gamete female gamete and genet genetic property cf Nicholson and Gawne Woodger elaborates these logical predicates or relations to produce a careful reconstruction of Mendelian genetics Here are two axioms in his system which are rewritten in contemporary notation since Woodger used Russell and Whitehead Principia Mathematica notation DLZxyz DLZuvz The first axiom should be read thus no gamete is both male and female In the second axiom given that DLZxyz is a primitive relation defined as is a zygote which develops in the environment into the life the translation is every life develops in one and only one environment from one and only one zygote Woodger claims that the whole of Mendel work can be expressed via this axiomatic system Woodger briefly mentions that if one assumes that the entire system or population is random with respect to gamete fusions then the Pearson Hardy law is derivable This was a reference to HWP In her explorations of various axiomatizations of Darwinian lineages and subclans and the process of the expansion of the fitter Williams also carefully defines concepts and axiomatizes basic biological principles of reproduction natural selection fitness and so forth However she does not address HWP Of interest is the lack of axiomatization of HWP or other mathematical principles of population genetics in Woodger and Williams work Were such principles considered secondary or uninteresting by Woodger and Williams Might Woodger and Williams respective axiomatic systems simply lack the power and conceptual resources to axiomatically reconstruct a mathematical edifice actually cast in terms of probability theory Finally other friends of the Syntactic View such as the early Michael Ruse do not provide an axiomatization of HWP Ruse Proponents of the Semantic View claim that their perspective on scientific theory accurately portrays the theoretical structure of population genetics Thompson provides both set theoretical and state space renditions of Mendelian genetics The first involves defining a set theoretic predicate for the system viz A where and A are sets representing respectively the total collection of alleles and loci in the population while and are functions assigning an allele to a specific location in respectively the diploid cells of an individual or the haploid gametic cells Axioms in this set theoretic formalization include The sets and A are finite and non empty In contrast the state space approach of the Semantic View articulates a phase space with each dimension representing allelic or genotypic frequencies cover and Chapter of Lloyd As an example for population genetic theory a central law of succession is the Hardy Weinberg law Thompson Mathematically the diploid version of HWP is written thus off Here and are the frequencies of two distinct alleles at a biallelic locus The left hand side represents the allele frequencies in the parental generation and a random mating pattern while the right hand side captures genotype frequencies in the offspring generation as predicted from the parental generation This is a null theoretical model actual genotypic and allelic frequencies of the offspring generation often deviate from predicted frequencies a lethal homozygote recessive would make the term Indeed HWP holds strictly only in abstracted and idealized populations with very specific properties infinitely large individuals reproduce randomly and only when there are no evolutionary forces operating in the population no selection mutation migration or drift Hartl and Clark Winther et al forthcoming HWP is useful also in the way it interacts with laws of succession for selection mutation and so forth Okasha This powerful population genetic principle is central to Semantic View analyses of the mathematical articulation of the theoretical structure of population genetics Recall that the Pragmatic View highlights the internal and external pluralism as well as the purposiveness of model and theory structure Consider recent uses of population genetic theory to specify the kinds and amounts of population structure existing in Homo sapiens In particular different measures and mathematical modeling methodologies are employed in investigating human genomic diversity Jobling et al Barbujani et al Kaplan and Winther Winther It is possible to distinguish at least two different research projects each of which has a unique pragmatic content aims values and methods Diversity partitioning assesses genetic variation within and among pre determined groups using Analysis of Variance also crucial to estimating heritability Downes Clustering analysis uses Bayesian modeling techniques to simultaneously produce clusters and assign individuals to these unsupervised cluster classifications The robust result of the first modeling project is that approximately of all genetic variance is found within human subpopulations Han Chinese or Sami across subpopulations within a continental region and only is found across continents Negroid Mongoloid and Caucasoid Lewontin terms Recall also that we are all already identical at on average out of nucleotides To calculate diversity partitions at these three nested levels Lewontin used a Shannon information theoretic measure closely related to Sewall Wright statistic FST Here HT is the total heterozygosity of the population assessed and is the heterozygosity of each subpopulation group of the relevant population averaged across all the subpopulations FST is bounded by and and is a measure of population structure with higher FST values suggesting more structure viz more group differentiation HWP appears implicitly in both HT and which take heterozygosity to be equal to the expected proportion of heterozygotes under HWP rather than the actual frequency of heterozygotes HT is computed by using the grand population average of and whereas calculating involves averaging across the expected heterozygosities of each subpopulation If random mating occurs and thus HWP applies across the entire population without respecting subpopulation borders then HT and will be equal of the total population and of each individual subpopulation will be the same likewise for If instead HWP applies only within subpopulations but not across the population as a whole then will be smaller than HT and FST will be positive there will be excess homozygosity across subpopulations which is known as the Wahlund Principle in population genetics This is one way among many to deploy the population genetic principle of HWP Thus the Lewontin style diversity partitioning result that only roughly of the total genetic variance is among races is equivalent to saying that FST across the big three continental populations in Lewontin three level model is Barbujani et al The basic philosophical tendency is to associate the diversity partitioning research project approximately result with an anti realist interpretation of biological race In contrast clustering analysis Pritchard et al Rosenberg et al cf Edwards can be readily performed even with the small amount of among continent genetic variance in Homo sapiens For instance when the Bayesian modeling computer program STRUCTURE is asked to produce clusters continental races appear African Amerindian Asian European and Pacific Islanders Interestingly this modeling technique is also intimately linked to HWP Our main modeling assumptions are Hardy Weinberg equilibrium within populations and complete linkage equilibrium between loci within populations Pritchard et al cf Winther That is for a cluster to eventually be robust in the modeling runs it should meet HWP expectations Clustering analysis has sometimes been interpreted as a justification for a realist stance towards biological race see discussions in Hochman Kaplan and Winther Winther and Kaplan Winther Edge and Rosenberg forthcoming Spencer forthcoming This example of the mathematical modeling of human genomic diversity teaches that basic and simple formal components can be used in different ways to develop and apply theory both inside and outside of science In contrast to the Syntactic and Semantic Views the Pragmatic View foregrounds tensions vis vis ontological assumptions and political consequences regarding the existence or not of biological race between diversity partitioning Lewontin and clustering analysis Pritchard et al research packages These ontological ruptures can be identified despite the fact that both research projects assess population structure by examining departures from HWP they measure excess homozygosity and are completely consistent Winther Ludwig Edge and Rosenberg forthcoming This exploration of how the three views on the structure of scientific theory address population genetics and in particular HWP invites a certain meta pluralism That is the Syntactic View carefully breaks down fundamental concepts and principles in genetics and population genetics articulating definitions and relations among terms The Semantic View insightfully decomposes and interweaves the complex mathematical edifice of population genetics The Pragmatic View sheds light on modeling choices and on distinct interpretations and applications of the same theory or model both within and without science The three perspectives are hardly mutually exclusive the two running examples concern theory structure in Newtonian mechanics and population genetics independently considered While interesting debates about evolutionary forces are beyond the scope of the current entry see Hitchcock and Velasco Conclusion The structure of scientific theories is a rich topic Theorizing and modeling are core activities across the sciences whether old relativity theory evolutionary theory or new climate modeling cognitive science and systems biology Furthermore theory remains essential to developing multipurpose tools such as statistical models and procedures Bayesian models for data analysis agent based models for simulation network theory for systems analysis Given the strength and relevance of theory and theorizing to the natural sciences and even to the social sciences microeconomics physical if not cultural anthropology philosophical attention to the structure of scientific theories could and should increase This piece has focused on a comparison of three major perspectives Syntactic View Semantic View and Pragmatic View In order to handle these complex debates effectively we have sidestepped certain key philosophical questions including questions about scientific realism scientific explanation and prediction theoretical and ontological reductionism knowledge production and epistemic inference the distinction between science and technology and the relationship between science and society Each of these topics bears further philosophical investigation in light of the three perspectives here explored A table helps summarize general aspects of the three views analyses of the structure of scientific theories Syntactic View Semantic View Pragmatic View Theory Structure Uninterpreted axiomatic system State space ii Model set theoretic Internal and external pluralism Theory Interpretation Correspondence rules Hierarchy of models ii Similarity iii Isomorphism Structure already inflected by practice function and application ii Pragmatic virtues Is theory interpretation an aspect of theory structure Yes No Yes although the distinction is hard to make Table General aspects of each view analysis of the structure of scientific theories The Syntactic Semantic and Pragmatic views are often taken to be mutually exclusive and thus to be in competition with one another They indeed make distinct claims about the anatomy of scientific theories But one can also imagine them to be complementary focusing on different aspects and questions of the structure of scientific theories and the process of scientific theorizing For instance in exploring nonformal and implicit components of theory the Pragmatic View accepts that scientific theories often include mathematical parts but tends to be less interested in these components Moreover there is overlap in questions Syntactic and Semantic Views share an interest in formalizing theory the Semantic and Pragmatic Views both exhibit concern for scientific practice How are these three views ultimately related A standard philosophical move is to generalize and abstract understanding a situation from a higher level One meta hypothesis is that a given philosophical analysis of theory structure tends to be associated with a perceived relationship among the three views here discussed The Syntactic View is inclined to interpret the Semantic View formal machinery as continuous with its own generalizing axiomatic strategy and hence diagnoses many standard Semantic View critiques Section as missing their mark the strategy of identity Friedman Worrall Halvorson Lutz cf Chakravartty The Semantic View explicitly contrasts its characterization of theory structure with the linguistic or metamathematical apparatus of the Syntactic View the strategy of combat Suppe van Fraassen Lloyd Finally the Pragmatic View which did not exist as a perspective until relatively recently imagines theory as pluralistic and can thus ground a holistic philosophical investigation It envisions a meta pluralism in which reconstructive axiomatization and mathematical modeling remain important though not necessary for all theories This third view endorses a panoply of theoretical structures and theorizing styles negotiating continuity both between theorizing and the experimental life and among philosophical analyses of the structure of scientific theories the strategy of complementarity Hacking Galison Craver Su√°rez and Cartwright Winther Griesemer By design the ecumenical meta pluralism sanctioned by the Pragmatic View does not completely offset identity and combat strategies Moreover only partial acceptance of the respective views may ultimately be possible Even so the complementarity strategy might be worth developing further Compared to identity and combat meta perspectives it provides broader or at least different insights into the structure of scientific theories More generally exploring the relations among these views is itself a rich topic for future philosophical work General Definitions Examples and Applications Definitions Categories are algebraic structures with many complementary natures geometric logical computational combinatorial just as groups are many faceted algebraic structures Eilenberg Mac Lane introduced categories in a purely auxiliary fashion as preparation for what they called functors and natural transformations The very definition of a category evolved over time according to the author chosen goals and metamathematical framework Eilenberg Mac Lane at first gave a purely abstract definition of a category along the lines of the axiomatic definition of a group Others starting with Grothendieck and Freyd elected for reasons of practicality to define categories in set theoretic terms An alternative approach that of Lawvere begins by characterizing the category of categories and then stipulates that a category is an object of that universe This approach under active development by various mathematicians logicians and mathematical physicists lead to what are now called higher dimensional categories Baez Baez Dolan Batanin Leinster Hermida et al The very definition of a category is not without philosophical importance since one of the objections to category theory as a foundational framework is the claim that since categories are defined as sets category theory cannot provide a philosophically enlightening foundation for mathematics We will briefly go over some of these definitions starting with Eilenberg Mac Lane algebraic definition However before going any further the following definition will be required Definition A mapping will be called an identity if and only if the existence of any product eŒ± or Œ≤e implies that eŒ± and Œ≤e Definition Eilenberg MacLane A category is an aggregate Ob of abstract elements called the objects of and abstract elements Map called mappings of the category The mappings are subject to the following five axioms Given three mappings and the triple product is defined if and only if is defined When either is defined the associative law holds This triple product is written The triple product is defined whenever both products and are defined For each mapping there is at least one identity such that is defined and at least one identity such that is defined The mapping eX corresponding to each object is an identity For each identity there is a unique object of such that eX As Eilenberg Mac Lane promptly remark objects play a secondary role and could be entirely omitted from the definition Doing so however would make the manipulation of the applications less convenient It is practically suitable and perhaps psychologically more simple to think in terms of mappings and objects The term aggregate is used by Eilenberg Mac Lane themselves presumably so as to remain neutral with respect to the background set theory one wants to adopt Eilenberg Mac Lane defined categories in for reasons of rigor As they note It should be observed first that the whole concept of a category is essentially an auxiliary one our basic concepts are essentially those of a functor and of natural transformation The idea of a category is required only by the precept that every function should have a definite class as domain and a definite class as range for the categories are provided as the domains and ranges of functors Thus one could drop the category concept altogether and adopt an even more intuitive standpoint in which a functor such as Hom is not defined over the category of all groups but for each particular pair of groups which may be given The standpoint would suffice for applications inasmuch as none of our developments will involve elaborate constructions on the categories themselves chap par Things changed in the following ten years when categories started to be used in homology theory and homological algebra Mac Lane Buchsbaum Grothendieck and Heller were considering categories in which the collections of morphisms between two fixed objects have an additional structure More specifically given any two objects and of a category the set Hom of morphisms from to form an abelian group Furthermore for reasons related to the ways homology and cohomology theories are linked the definition of a category had to satisfy an additional formal property which we will leave aside for the moment it had to be self dual These requirements lead to the following definition Definition A category can be described as a set Ob whose members are the objects of satisfying the following three conditions Morphism For every pair of objects there is a set Hom called the morphisms from to in If is a morphism from to we write Identity For every object there exists a morphism idX in Hom called the identity on Composition For every triple and of objects there exists a partial binary operation from Hom Hom to Hom called the composition of morphisms in If and the composition of and is notated Identity morphisms and composition satisfy two axioms Associativity If and then Identity If then idY and idX This is the definition one finds in most textbooks of category theory As such it explicitly relies on a set theoretical background and language An alternative suggested by Lawvere in the early sixties is to develop an adequate language and background framework for a category of categories We will not present the formal framework here for it would take us too far from our main concern but the basic idea is to define what are called weak categories and weak categories and what had been called categories would then be called weak categories and sets would be weak categories See for instance Baez Makkai Leinster Baez May Simpson Also in the sixties Lambek proposed to look at categories as deductive systems This begins with the notion of a graph consisting of two classes Arrows and Objects and two mappings between them Arrows Objects and Arrows Objects namely the source and the target mappings The arrows are usually called the oriented edges and the objects nodes or vertices Following this a deductive system is a graph with a specified arrow idX and a binary operation on arrows Given and the composition of and is Of course the objects of a deductive system are normally thought of as formulas the arrows are thought of as proofs or deductions and operations on arrows are thought of as rules of inference A category is then defined thus Definition Lambek A category is a deductive system in which the following equations hold between proofs for all and idX idY Thus by imposing an adequate equivalence relation upon proofs any deductive system can be turned into a category It is therefore legitimate to think of a category as an algebraic encoding of a deductive system This phenomenon is already well known to logicians but probably not to its fullest extent An example of such an algebraic encoding is the Lindenbaum Tarski algebra a Boolean algebra corresponding to classical propositional logic Since a Boolean algebra is a poset it is also a category Notice also that Boolean algebras with appropriate homomorphisms between them form another useful category in logic Thus far we have merely a change of vocabulary Things become more interesting when first order and higher order logics are considered The Lindenbaum Tarski algebra for these systems when properly carried out yields categories sometimes called conceptual categories or syntactic categories Mac Lane Moerdijk Makkai Reyes Pitts Examples Almost every known example of a mathematical structure with the appropriate structure preserving map yields a category The category Set with objects sets and morphisms the usual functions There are variants here one can consider partial functions instead or injective functions or again surjective functions In each case the category thus constructed is different The category Top with objects topological spaces and morphisms continuous functions Again one could restrict morphisms to open continuous functions and obtain a different category The category hoTop with objects topological spaces and morphisms equivalence classes of homotopic functions This category is not only important in mathematical practice it is at the core of algebraic topology but it is also a fundamental example of a category in which morphisms are not structure preserving functions The category Vec with objects vector spaces and morphisms linear maps The category Diff with objects differential manifolds and morphisms smooth maps The categories Pord and PoSet with objects preorders and posets respectively and morphisms monotone functions The categories Lat and Bool with objects lattices and Boolean algebras respectively and morphisms structure preserving homomorphisms homomorphisms The category Heyt with objects Heyting algebras and homomorphisms The category Mon with objects monoids and morphisms monoid homomorphisms The category AbGrp with objects abelian groups and morphisms group homomorphisms homomorphisms The category Grp with objects groups and morphisms group homomorphisms homomorphisms The category Rings with objects rings with unit and morphisms ring homomorphisms homomorphisms The category Fields with objects fields and morphisms fields homomorphisms homomorphisms Any deductive system with objects formulae and morphisms proofs These examples nicely illustrates how category theory treats the notion of structure in a uniform manner Note that a category is characterized by its morphisms and not by its objects Thus the category of topological spaces with open maps differs from the category of topological spaces with continuous maps or more to the point the categorical properties of the latter differ from those of the former We should underline again the fact that not all categories are made of structured sets with structure preserving maps Thus any preordered set is a category For given two elements of a preordered set there is a morphism if and only if Hence a preordered set is a category in which there is at most one morphism between any two objects Any monoid and thus any group can be seen as a category in this case the category has only one object and its morphisms are the elements of the monoid Composition of morphisms corresponds to multiplication of monoid elements That the monoid axioms correspond to the category axioms is easily verified Hence the notion of category generalizes those of preorder and monoid We should also point out that a groupoid has a very simple definition in a categorical context it is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism that is for any morphism there is a morphism such that idX and idY Fundamental Concepts of the Theory Category theory unifies mathematical structures in two different ways First as we have seen almost every set theoretically defined mathematical structure with the appropriate notion of homomorphism yields a category This is a unification provided within a set theoretical environment Second and perhaps even more important once a type of structure has been defined it is imperative to determine how new structures can be constructed out of the given one For instance given two sets A and set theory allows us to construct their Cartesian product A It is also imperative to determine how given structures can be decomposed into more elementary substructures For example given a finite Abelian group how can it be decomposed into a product of certain of its subgroups In both cases it is necessary to know how structures of a certain kind may combine The nature of these combinations might appear to be considerably different when looked at from a purely set theoretical perspective Category theory reveals that many of these constructions are in fact certain objects in a category having a universal property Indeed from a categorical point of view a Cartesian product in set theory a direct product of groups Abelian or otherwise a product of topological spaces and a conjunction of propositions in a deductive system are all instances of a categorical product characterized by a universal property Formally a product of two objects and in a category is an object of together with two morphisms called the projections and such that and this is the universal property for all objects with morphisms and there is a unique morphism such that and Note that we have defined a product for and and not the product for and Indeed products and other objects with a universal property are defined only up to a unique isomorphism Thus in category theory the nature of the elements constituting a certain construction is irrelevant What matters is the way an object is related to the other objects of the category that is the morphisms going in and the morphisms going out or put differently how certain structures can be mapped into a given object and how a given object can map its structure into other structures of the same kind Category theory reveals how different kinds of structures are related to one another For instance in algebraic topology topological spaces are related to groups and modules rings etc in various ways such as homology cohomology homotopy theory As noted above groups with group homomorphisms constitute a category Eilenberg Mac Lane invented category theory precisely in order to clarify and compare these connections What matters are the morphisms between categories given by functors Informally functors are structure preserving maps between categories Given two categories and a functor from to sends objects of to objects of and morphisms of to morphisms of in such a way that composition of morphisms in is preserved and identity morphisms are preserved idX idFX It immediately follows that a functor preserves commutativity of diagrams between categories Homology cohomology homotopy theory are all example of functors A more direct example is provided by the power set operation which yields two functors on the category of sets depending on how one defines its action on functions Thus given a set is the usual set of subsets of and given a function takes a subset A of and maps it to A the image of restricted to A in It is easily verified that this defines a functor from the category of sets into itself In general there are many functors between two given categories and the question of how they are connected suggests itself For instance given a category there is always the identity functor from to which sends every object morphism of to itself In particular there is the identity functor over the category of sets Now the identity functor is related in a natural manner to the power set functor described above Indeed given a set and its power set there is a function hX which takes an element of and sends it to the singleton set a subset of an element of This function in fact belongs to a family of functions indexed by the objects of the category of sets hY in Ob Set Moreover it satisfies the following commutativity condition given any function the identity functor yields the same function Id Id Id The commutativity condition thus becomes hY Id hX Thus the family of functions relates the two functors in a natural manner Such families of morphisms are called natural transformations between functors Similarly natural transformations between models of a theory yield the usual homomorphisms of structures in the traditional set theoretical framework The above notions while important are not fundamental to category theory The latter heading arguably include the notions of limit colimit in turn these are special cases of what is certainly the cornerstone of category theory the concept of adjoint functors first defined by Daniel Kan in and published in Adjoint functors can be thought of as being conceptual inverses This is probably best illustrated by an example Let Grp Set be the forgetful functor that is the functor that sends to each group its underlying set of elements and to a group homomorphism the underlying set function In other words forgets about the group structure and forgets the fact that morphisms are group homomorphisms The categories Grp and Set are certainly not isomorphic as categories to one another A simple argument runs as follows the category Grp has a zero object whereas Set does not Thus we certainly cannot find an inverse in the usual algebraic sense to the functor But there are many non isomorphic ways to define a group structure on a given set and one might hope that among these constructions at least one is functorial and systematically related to the functor What is the conceptual inverse to the operation of forgetting all the group theoretical structure and obtaining a set It is to construct a group from a set solely on the basis of the concept of group and nothing else with no extraneous relation or data Such a group is constructed freely that is with no restriction whatsoever except those imposed by the axioms of the theory In other words all that is remembered in the process of constructing a group from a given set is the fact that the resulting construction has to be a group Such a construction exists it is functorial and it yields what are called free groups In other words there is a functor Set Grp which to any set assigns the free group on and to each function the group homomorphism defined in the obvious manner The situation can be described thusly we have two conceptual contexts a group theoretical context and a set theoretical context and two functors moving systematically from one context to the other in opposite directions One of these functors is elementary namely the forgetful functor It is apparently trivial and uninformative The other functor is mathematically significant and important The surprising fact is that is related to by a simple rule and in some sense it arises from One of the striking features of adjoint situations is precisely the fact that fundamental mathematical and logical constructions arise out of given and often elementary functors The fact that and are conceptual inverses expresses itself formally as follows applying first and then does not yield the original set but there is a fundamental relationship between and UF Indeed there is a function UF called the unit of the adjunction that simply sends each element of to itself in UF and this function satisfies the following universal property given any function there is a unique group homomorphism such that In other words UF is the best possible solution to the problem of inserting elements of into a group what is called insertion of generators in the mathematical jargon Composing and in the opposite order we get a morphism FU called the counit of the adjunction satisfying the following universal property for any group homomorphism there is a unique function such that FU constitutes the best possible solution to the problem of finding a representation of as a quotient of a free group If and were simple algebraic inverses to one another we would have the following identity UF ISet and FU IGrp where ISet denotes the identity functor on Set and IGrp the identity functor on Grp As we have indicated these identities certainly do not hold in this case However some identities do hold they are best expressed with the help of the commutative diagrams where the diagonal arrows denote the appropriate identity natural transformations This is but one case of a very common situation every free construction can be described as arising from an appropriate forgetful functor between two adequately chosen categories The number of mathematical constructions that can be described as adjoints is simply stunning Although the details of each one of these constructions vary considerably the fact that they can all be described using the same language illustrates the profound unity of mathematical concepts and mathematical thinking Before we give more examples a formal and abstract definition of adjoint functors is in order Definition Let and be functors going in opposite directions is a left adjoint to a right adjoint to denoted by if there exists natural transformations IC GF and FG ID such that the composites and are the identity natural transformations For different but equivalent definitions see Mac Lane or chap IV Here are some of the important facts regarding adjoint functors Firstly adjoints are unique up to isomorphism that is any two left adjoints and of a functor are naturally isomorphic Secondly the notion of adjointness is formally equivalent to the notion of a universal morphism or construction and to that of representable functor See for instance Mac Lane chap IV Each and every one of these notions exhibit an aspect of a given situation Thirdly a left adjoint preserves all the colimits which exist in its domain and dually a right adjoint preserves all the limits which exist in its domain We now give some examples of adjoint situations to illustrate the pervasiveness of the notion Instead of having a forgetful functor going into the category of sets in some cases only a part of the structure is forgotten Here are two standard examples There is an obvious forgetful functor AbGrp AbMon from the category of abelian groups to the category of abelian monoids forgets about the inverse operation The functor has a left adjoint AbMon AbGrp which given an abelian monoid assigns to it the best possible abelian group such that can be embedded in as a submonoid For instance if is then is that is it is isomorphic to Similarly there is an obvious forgetful functor Haus Top from the category of Hausdorff topological spaces to the category of topological spaces which forgets the Hausdorff condition Again there is a functor Top Haus such that Given a topological space yields the best Hausdorff space constructed from it is the quotient of by the closure of the diagonal ŒîX which is an equivalence relation In contrast with the previous example where we had an embedding this time we get a quotient of the original structure Consider now the category of compact Hausdorff spaces kHaus and the forgetful functor kHaus Top which forgets the compactness property and the separation property The left adjoint to this is the Stone Cech compactification There is a forgetful functor ModR AbGrp from a category of modules to the category of abelian groups where is a commutative ring with unit The functor forgets the action of on a group The functor has both a left and a right adjoint The left adjoint is AbGrp ModR which sends an abelian group to the tensor product and the right adjoint is given by the functor Hom AbGrp ModR which assigns to any group the modules of linear mappings Hom The case where the categories and are posets deserves special attention here Adjoint functors in this context are usually called Galois connections Let be a poset Consider the diagonal functor with and for In this case the left adjoint to is the coproduct or the sup and the right adjoint to is the product or the inf The adjoint situation can be described in the following special form where the vertical double arrow can be interpreted as rules of inference going in both directions Implication can also be introduced Consider a functor with a parameter It can easily be verified that when is a poset the function is order preserving and therefore a functor A right adjoint to is a functor that yields the largest element of such that its infimum with is smaller than This element is sometimes called the relative pseudocomplement of or more commonly the implication It is denoted by or by The adjunction can be presented as follows The negation operator can be introduced from the last adjunction Indeed let be the bottom element of the lattice Then since is always true it follows that is also always true But since is always the case we get at the numerator that Hence is the largest element disjoint from We can therefore put def Limits colimits and all the fundamental constructions of category theory can be described as adjoints Thus products and coproducts are adjoints as are equalizers coequalizers pullbacks and pushouts etc This is one of the reasons adjointness is central to category theory itself because all the fundamental operations of category theory arise from adjoint situations An equivalence of categories is a special case of adjointness Indeed if in the above triangular identities the arrows IC GF and FG ID are natural isomorphisms then the functors and constitute an equivalence of categories In practice it is the notion of equivalence of categories that matters and not the notion of isomorphism of categories It is easy to prove certain facts about these operations directly from the adjunctions Consider for instance implication Let Then we get at the numerator that which is always true in a poset as is easily verified Hence is also true for all and this is only possible if the top element of the lattice Not only can logical operations be described as adjoints but they naturally arise as adjoints to basic operations In fact adjoints can be used to define various structures distributive lattices Heyting algebras Boolean algebras etc See Wood It should be clear from the simple foregoing example how the formalism of adjointness can be used to give syntactic presentations of various logical theories Furthermore and this is a key element the standard universal and existential quantifiers can be shown to be arising as adjoints to the operation of substitution Thus quantifiers are on a par with the other logical operations in sharp contrast with the other algebraic approaches to logic See for instance Awodey or Mac Lane Moerdijk More generally Lawvere showed how syntax and semantics are related by adjoint functors See Lawvere Dualities play an important role in mathematics and they can be described with the help of equivalences between categories In other words many important mathematical theorems can be translated as statements about the existence of adjoint functors sometimes satisfying additional properties This is sometimes taken as expressing the conceptual content of the theorem Consider the following fundamental case let be the category whose objects are the locally compact abelian groups and the morphisms are the continuous group homomorphisms Then the Pontryagin duality theorem amounts to the claim that the category is equivalent to the category that is to the opposite category Of course the precise statement requires that we describe the functors and and prove that they constitute an equivalence of categories Another well known and important duality was discovered by Stone in the thirties and now bears his name In one direction an arbitrary Boolean algebra yields a topological space and in the other direction from a compact Hausdorff and totally disconnected topological space one obtains a Boolean algebra Moreover this correspondence is functorial any Boolean homomorphism is sent to a continuous map of topological spaces and conversely any continuous map between the spaces is sent to a Boolean homomorphism In other words there is an equivalence of categories between the category of Boolean algebras and the dual of the category of Boolean spaces also called Stone spaces See Johnstone for an excellent introduction and more developments The connection between a category of algebraic structures and the opposite of a category of topological structures established by Stone theorem constitutes but one example of a general phenomenon that did attract and still attracts a great deal of attention from category theorists Categorical study of duality theorems is still a very active and significant field and is largely inspired by Stone result For recent applications in logic see for instance Makkai Taylor Caramello Brief Historical Sketch It is difficult to do justice to the short but intricate history of the field In particular it is not possible to mention all those who have contributed to its rapid development With this word of caution out of the way we will look at some of the main historical threads Categories functors natural transformations limits and colimits appeared almost out of nowhere in a paper by Eilenberg Mac Lane entitled General Theory of Natural Equivalences We say almost because their earlier paper contains specific functors and natural transformations at work limited to groups A desire to clarify and abstract their results led Eilenberg Mac Lane to devise category theory The central notion at the time as their title indicates was that of natural transformation In order to give a general definition of the latter they defined functor borrowing the term from Carnap and in order to define functor they borrowed the word category from the philosophy of Aristotle Kant and Peirce but redefining it mathematically After their paper it was not clear that the concepts of category theory would amount to more than a convenient language this indeed was the status quo for about fifteen years Category theory was employed in this manner by Eilenberg Steenrod in an influential book on the foundations of algebraic topology and by Cartan Eilenberg in a ground breaking book on homological algebra Curiously although Eilenberg Steenrod defined categories Cartan Eilenberg simply assumed them These books allowed new generations of mathematicians to learn algebraic topology and homological algebra directly in the categorical language and to master the method of diagrams Indeed without the method of diagram chasing many results in these two books seem inconceivable or at the very least would have required a considerably more intricate presentation The situation changed radically with Grothendieck landmark paper entitled Sur quelques points alg√®bre homologique in which the author employed categories intrinsically to define and construct more general theories which he Grothendieck then applied to specific fields to algebraic geometry Kan showed that adjoint functors subsume the important concepts of limits and colimits and could capture fundamental concepts in other areas in his case homotopy theory At this point category theory became more than a convenient language by virtue of two developments Employing the axiomatic method and the language of categories Grothendieck defined in an abstract fashion types of categories additive and Abelian categories showed how to perform various constructions in these categories and proved various results about them In a nutshell Grothendieck showed how to develop part of homological algebra in an abstract setting of this sort From then on a specific category of structures a category of sheaves over a topological space could be seen as a token of an abstract category of a certain type an Abelian category One could therefore immediately see how the methods of homological algebra could be applied to for instance algebraic geometry Furthermore it made sense to look for other types of abstract categories ones that would encapsulate the fundamental and formal aspects of various mathematical fields in the same way that Abelian categories encapsulated fundamental aspects of homological algebra Thanks in large part to the efforts of Freyd and Lawvere category theorists gradually came to see the pervasiveness of the concept of adjoint functors Not only does the existence of adjoints to given functors permit definitions of abstract categories and presumably those which are defined by such means have a privileged status but as we mentioned earlier many important theorems and even theories in various fields can be seen as equivalent to the existence of specific functors between particular categories By the early the concept of adjoint functors was seen as central to category theory With these developments category theory became an autonomous field of research and pure category theory could be developed And indeed it did grow rapidly as a discipline but also in its applications mainly in its source contexts namely algebraic topology and homological algebra but also in algebraic geometry and after the appearance of Lawvere Ph thesis in universal algebra This thesis also constitutes a landmark in this history of the field for in it Lawvere proposed the category of categories as a foundation for category theory set theory and thus the whole of mathematics as well as using categories for the study of the logical aspects of mathematics Over the course of the Lawvere outlined the basic framework for an entirely original approach to logic and the foundations of mathematics He achieved the following Axiomatized the category of sets Lawvere and of categories Lawvere Gave a categorical description of theories that was independent of syntactical choices and sketched how completeness theorems for logical systems could be obtained by categorical methods Lawvere Characterized Cartesian closed categories and showed their connections to logical systems and various logical paradoxes Lawvere Showed that the quantifiers and the comprehension schemes could be captured as adjoint functors to given elementary operations Lawvere Argued that adjoint functors should generally play a major foundational role through the notion of categorical doctrines Lawvere Meanwhile Lambek described categories in terms of deductive systems and employed categorical methods for proof theoretical purposes All this work culminated in another notion thanks to Grothendieck and his school that of a topos Even though toposes appeared in the in the context of algebraic geometry again from the mind of Grothendieck it was certainly Lawvere and Tierney elementary axiomatization of a topos which gave impetus to its attaining foundational status Very roughly an elementary topos is a category possessing a logical structure sufficiently rich to develop most of ordinary mathematics that is most of what is taught to mathematics undergraduates As such an elementary topos can be thought of as a categorical theory of sets But it is also a generalized topological space thus providing a direct connection between logic and geometry For more on the history of categorical logic see Marquis Reyes Bell The saw the development and application of the topos concept in many different directions The very first applications outside algebraic geometry were in set theory where various independence results were recast in terms of topos Tierney Bunge but also Blass Scedrov Blass Scedrov Freyd Mac Lane Moerdijk Scedrov Connections with intuitionistic and more generally constructive mathematics were noted early on and toposes are still used to investigate models of various aspects of intuitionism and constructivism Lambek Scott Mac Lane Moerdijk Van der Hoeven Moerdijk Moerdijk Moerdijk Moerdijk Moerdijk Palmgren Moerdijk Palmgren Palmgren For more on the history of topos theory see McLarty More recently topos theory has been employed to investigate various forms of constructive mathematics or set theory Joyal Moerdijk Taylor Awodey recursiveness and models of higher order type theories generally The introduction of the so called effective topos and the search for axioms for synthetic domain theory are worth mentioning Hyland Hyland Hyland et al McLarty Jacobs Van Oosten Van Oosten and the references therein Lawvere early motivation was to provide a new foundation for differential geometry a lively research area which is now called synthetic differential geometry Lawvere Kock Bell Moerdijk Reyes This is only the tip of the iceberg toposes could prove to be for the century what Lie groups were to the century From the to the present category theory has found new applications In theoretical computer science category theory is now firmly rooted and contributes among other things to the development of new logical systems and to the semantics of programming Pitts Plotkin Scott and the references therein Its applications to mathematics are becoming more diverse even touching on theoretical physics which employs higher dimensional category theory which is to category theory what higher dimensional geometry is to plane geometry to study the so called quantum groups and quantum field theory Majid Baez Dolan and other publications by these authors Philosophical Significance Category theory challenges philosophers in two ways which are not necessarily mutually exclusive On the one hand it is certainly the task of philosophy to clarify the general epistemological and ontological status of categories and categorical methods both in the practice of mathematics and in the foundational landscape On the other hand philosophers and philosophical logicians can employ category theory and categorical logic to explore philosophical and logical problems I now discuss these challenges briefly in turn Category theory is now a common tool in the mathematician toolbox that much is clear It is also clear that category theory organizes and unifies much of mathematics See for instance Mac Lane or Pedicchio Tholen No one will deny these simple facts Doing mathematics in a categorical framework is almost always radically different from doing it in a set theoretical framework the exception being working with the internal language of a Boolean topos whenever the topos is not Boolean then the main difference lies in the fact that the logic is intuitionistic Hence as is often the case when a different conceptual framework is adopted many basic issues regarding the nature of the objects studied the nature of the knowledge involved and the nature of the methods used have to be reevaluated We will take up these three aspects in turn Two facets of the nature of mathematical objects within a categorical framework have to be emphasized First objects are always given in a category An object exists in and depends upon an ambient category Furthermore an object is characterized by the morphisms going in it and or the morphisms coming out of it Second objects are always characterized up to isomorphism in the best cases up to a unique isomorphism There is no such thing for instance as the natural numbers However it can be argued that there is such a thing as the concept of natural numbers Indeed the concept of natural numbers can be given unambiguously via the Dedekind Peano Lawvere axioms but what this concept refers to in specific cases depends on the context in which it is interpreted the category of sets or a topos of sheaves over a topological space It is hard to resist the temptation to think that category theory embodies a form of structuralism that it describes mathematical objects as structures since the latter presumably are always characterized up to isomorphism Thus the key here has to do with the kind of criterion of identity at work within a categorical framework and how it resembles any criterion given for objects which are thought of as forms in general One of the standard objections presented against this view is that if objects are thought of as structures and only as abstract structures meaning here that they are separated from any specific or concrete representation then it is impossible to locate them within the mathematical universe See Hellman for a standard formulation of the objection McLarty Awodey Landry Marquis Shapiro Landry Linnebo Pettigrew McLarty for relevant material on the issue A slightly different way to make sense of the situation is to think of mathematical objects as types for which there are tokens given in different contexts This is strikingly different from the situation one finds in set theory in which mathematical objects are defined uniquely and their reference is given directly Although one can make room for types within set theory via equivalence classes or isomorphism types in general the basic criterion of identity within that framework is given by the axiom of extensionality and thus ultimately reference is made to specific sets Furthermore it can be argued that the relation between a type and its token is not represented adequately by the membership relation A token does not belong to a type it is not an element of a type but rather it is an instance of it In a categorical framework one always refers to a token of a type and what the theory characterizes directly is the type not the tokens In this framework one does not have to locate a type but tokens of it are at least in mathematics epistemologically required This is simply the reflection of the interaction between the abstract and the concrete in the epistemological sense and not the ontological sense of these latter expressions See Ellerman Marquis Marquis Marquis The history of category theory offers a rich source of information to explore and take into account for an historically sensitive epistemology of mathematics It is hard to imagine for instance how algebraic geometry and algebraic topology could have become what they are now without categorical tools See for instance Carter Corfield Kr√∂mer Marquis McLarty McLarty Category theory has lead to reconceptualizations of various areas of mathematics based on purely abstract foundations Moreover when developed in a categorical framework traditional boundaries between disciplines are shattered and reconfigured to mention but one important example topos theory provides a direct bridge between algebraic geometry and logic to the point where certain results in algebraic geometry are directly translated into logic and vice versa Certain concepts that were geometrical in origin are more clearly seen as logical for example the notion of coherent topos Algebraic topology also lurks in the background On a different but important front it can be argued that the distinction between mathematics and metamathematics cannot be articulated in the way it has been All these issues have to be reconsidered and reevaluated Moving closer to mathematical practice category theory allowed for the development of methods that have changed and continue to change the face of mathematics It could be argued that category theory represents the culmination of one of deepest and most powerful tendencies in twentieth century mathematical thought the search for the most general and abstract ingredients in a given situation Category theory is in this sense the legitimate heir of the Dedekind Hilbert Noether Bourbaki tradition with its emphasis on the axiomatic method and algebraic structures When used to characterize a specific mathematical domain category theory reveals the frame upon which that area is built the overall structure presiding to its stability strength and coherence The structure of this specific area in a sense might not need to rest on anything that is on some solid soil for it might very well be just one part of a larger network that is without any Archimedean point as if floating in space To use a well known metaphor from a categorical point of view Neurath ship has become a spaceship Still it remains to be seen whether category theory should be on the same plane so to speak as set theory whether it should be taken as a serious alternative to set theory as a foundation for mathematics or whether it is foundational in a different sense altogether That this very question applies even more forcefully to topos theory will not detain us Lawvere from early on promoted the idea that a category of categories could be used as a foundational framework See Lawvere This proposal now rests in part on the development of higher dimensional categories also called weak categories See for instance Makkai The advent of topos theory in the seventies brought new possibilities Mac Lane has suggested that certain toposes be considered as a genuine foundation for mathematics See Mac Lane Lambek proposed the so called free topos as the best possible framework in the sense that mathematicians with different philosophical outlooks might nonetheless agree to adopt it See Couture Lambek Lambek He has recently argued that there is no topos that can thoroughly satisfy a classical mathematician See Lambek For more on the various foundational views among category theorists see Landry Marquis Arguments have been advanced for and against category theory as a foundational framework Blass surveys the relationships between category theory and set theory Feferman Bell and Hellman argue against category theory See Marquis for a quick overview and proposal and McLarty and Awodey for replies to Hellman This matter is further complicated by the fact that the foundations of category theory itself have yet to be clarified For there may be many different ways to think of a universe of higher dimensional categories as a foundations for mathematics An adequate language for such a universe still has to be presented together with definite axioms for mathematics See Makkai for a short description of such a language A different approach based on homotopy theory but with closed connections with higher dimensional categories has been proposed by Voevodsky et al and is being vigorously pursued See the book Homotopy Type Theory by Awodey et al It is an established fact that category theory is employed to study logic and philosophy Indeed categorical logic the study of logic by categorical means has been under way for about years now and still vigorous Some of the philosophically relevant results obtained in categorical logic are The hierarchy of categorical doctrines regular categories coherent categories Heyting categories and Boolean categories all these

that almost all the surprising results of constructive and intuitionistic mathematics can be modeled in a proper categorical setting At the same time the standard set theoretic notions Tarski semantics have found natural generalizations in categories Thus categorical logic has roots in logic as it was developed in the twentieth century while at the same time providing a powerful and novel framework with numerous links to other parts of mathematics Category theory also bears on more general philosophical questions From the foregoing disussion it should be obvious that category theory and categorical logic ought to have an impact on almost all issues arising in philosophy of logic from the nature of identity criteria to the question of alternative logics category theory always sheds a new light on these topics Similar remarks can be made when we turn to ontology in particular formal ontology the part whole relation boundaries of systems ideas of space etc Ellerman has bravely attempted to show that category theory constitutes a theory of universals one having properties radically different from set theory which is also seen as a theory of universals Moving from ontology to cognitive science MacNamara Reyes have tried to employ categorical logic to provide a different logic of reference In particular they have attempted to clarify the relationships between count nouns and mass terms Other researchers are using category theory to study complex systems cognitive neural networks and analogies See for instance Ehresmann Vanbremeersch Healy Healy Caudell Arzi Gonczarowski Brown Porter Finally philosophers of science have turned to category theory to shed a new light on issues related to structuralism in science See for instance Brading Landry Bain Lam

dimensional categories physics and philosophyImpartiality Impartiality is sometimes treated by philosophers as if it were equivalent to moral impartiality Or at the very least the former word is often used without the qualifying adjective moral even when it is the particularly moral concept that is intended This is misleading since impartiality in its broadest sense is best understood as a formal notion while moral impartiality in particular is a substantive concept and one concerning which there is considerable dispute This entry will be predominantly concerned with moral impartiality the sort of impartiality that is that commonly features in normative moral and political theories However we will begin by addressing the broader formal concept and we will end with a brief discussion of issues raised by epistemic rather than moral impartiality It is all too easy to assume that the word impartiality must denote a positive unitary concept presumably a concept closely linked with if not identical to morality This however is simply not the case Rather there are various sorts of behavior that may be described as impartial and some of these obviously have little or nothing to do with morality A person who chooses an accountant on the basis of her friends recommendations may be entirely impartial between the various candidates members of the pool of local accountants with respect to their gender their age or where they went to school Yet if her choice is motivated solely by rational self interested considerations then it is clear that the impartiality she manifests is in no way a form of moral impartiality To take a more extreme case consider an insane serial killer who chooses his victims on the basis of their resemblance to that some celebrity The killer may be impartial with respect to his victims occupations religious beliefs and so forth but it would be absurd to regard this as a form of moral impartiality despite the fact that in certain contexts morality does require impartiality with respect to such considerations It is also worth noting that some types of impartiality may in themselves be immoral or morally questionable Suppose that I decide to pass along a treasured family heirloom to one of my two sons Bill and Phil Flipping a coin would constitute one type of impartial procedure for choosing between the two But suppose that I have already promised the heirloom to Phil on several occasions In this case it would be quite wrong to allow a coin toss to determine whether he gets it Deciding by means of a coin toss would be an impartial procedure but it would be the wrong sort of impartiality here for it would ignore the moral obligation created by my previous promises The word impartiality then picks out a broad concept that need not have anything to do with morality Indeed the final species of impartiality discussed below epistemic impartiality is not essentially a moral concept at all In this broad sense impartiality is probably best characterized in a negative rather than positive manner an impartial choice is simply one in which a certain sort of consideration some property of the individuals being chosen between has no influence An analysis along these lines has been proposed by Bernard Gert Gert analysis holds that A is impartial in respect with regard to group if and only if A actions in respect are not influenced at all by which member of benefit or are harmed by these actions Gert Thus for Gert impartiality is a property of a set of decisions made by a particular agent directed toward a particular group Gert analysis captures the important fact that one cannot simply ask of a given agent whether or not she is impartial Rather we must also specify with regard to whom she is impartial and in what respect Gert analysis then permits and indeed requires that we make fairly fine grained distinctions between various sorts of impartiality This is necessary since one and the same agent might manifest various sorts of partiality and impartiality towards various groups of persons Consider for instance a university professor who is also a mother of five children and who is currently acting as a member of a hiring committee Such an agent might be impartial between her children with respect to the care they receive while preferring her own children over others in this respect and also impartial between the various job candidates but it is clear that these two uses of the word impartial denote very different practices In particular the idea of merit applies in one case but not the other to be impartial between job candidates is presumably to select between them on the basis of merit whereas to be impartial between one children is not to think of merit at all but rather to provide equal protection and care to all Many attempts to characterize impartiality fail to respect the distinction between the broadest most formalistic sense of the notion and a more specifically moral impartiality To say for instance that an impartial choice is one that is free of bias or prejudice is to presuppose that we are dealing with a certain sort of impartiality that which is required or recommended by morality or at least worthy of moral approbation Bias and prejudice are loaded terms suggesting not only that some consideration is being excluded but also that the exclusion is appropriate and warranted Similarly the idea that impartiality requires that we give equal and or adequate consideration to the interests of all concerned parties goes well beyond the requirements of the merely formal notion In the coin toss case it is quite clear that Phil claims to the heirloom are not being given equal or adequate consideration As a characterization of moral impartiality however this suggestion is considerably more promising It is characteristic of modern moral thought to see impartiality as a requirement of if not a fundamental component of morality However the precise nature of this connection remains disputed As Brad Hooker has pointed out there are at least three levels at which assessments of moral impartiality may be made First one may ask whether moral rules are being impartially applied Second impartial benevolence may be used as a direct guide to practical decisions And third the content of first order moral rules may be assessed from an impartial standpoint Hooker We will begin with the second interpretation the idea that to act morally is to act from the standpoint of impartial benevolence This idea has exerted considerable influence and many writers have simply assumed that to assert the importance of impartiality in the context of morality just is to accept the idea of acting from such a perspective It is generally agreed that some sort of close connection obtains between morality and impartiality Indeed the phrases moral point of view and impartial or impersonal point of view are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to the imagined impersonal perspective from which it is supposed moral judgments are to be made Baier chapter Harsanyi Scheffler Smith Wolf see also Blum Chapter As noted above however the word impartial is a general term with many particular species it follows from this that the phrase impartial point of view is itself ambiguous At most it might be that the moral point of view constitutes one sort of impartial point of view It is not clear however that the demands of impartial benevolence are sufficient to exhaust those of morality Treating a person appropriately and respectfully may well require certain sorts of emotional and or cognitive responses sensitivity to her needs and values empathy for her suffering and the like But if these responses are pictured as the results of positive traits or attributes and not simply as say the result of a lack of bias or prejudice then it is not clear that merely being impartial between persons is sufficient to guarantee that one will possess and display the necessary sensitivities Indeed characterizations of impartial agents which proceed in negative terms that is by defining various preferences emotions or bits of information that she does not possess or that do not move her often risk picturing the impartial agent as impersonal and even indifferent Henberg Brandt A second problem for the claim that the moral point of view is identical with some version of the impartial point of view or indeed for any view which identifies morality and impartiality in the direct sense is that it seems plausible to regard some forms of moral partiality as morally admirable and perhaps even morally required Blum Cottingham Jeske Fumerton Jollimore Kapur Kekes MacIntyre Oldenquist Loyalty to one family community or country for instance is commonly regarded as a virtue Yet such an attitude is a clear and indeed paradigmatic example of partiality requiring that an agent feel and act differently toward one set of persons than she does toward humanity in general Similarly certain specific moral duties arising from certain particular relationships seem to involve partiality in an irreducible manner Parents for example are thought to be morally obliged to take special care of their own children to regard one child as merely one among millions would be regarded as highly eccentric if not monstrous Of course some moral duties do require that an agent be impartial in performing them But on common sense moral views at least impartiality seems mostly to be required in the context of specific roles such as when a person is acting as a judge an umpire a journalist or a representative of some public institution or perhaps when we are evaluating and selecting first order moral rules Baron Blum Cottingham The idea that impartiality is a pervasive and universal moral requirement that should be directly manifested in our thoughts and practices during daily life seems to contradict our ordinary moral intuitions Whether there exists such a thing as morally admirable partiality is the main issue that separates the so called partialists from the impartialists Partialists in general tend to claim that morally admirable partiality does exist that it cannot be reduced to any form of impartiality at a more fundamental level and that these facts pose a serious problem for those who claim that morality and some form of impartiality are identical or even closely related Impartialists by contrast either deny the existence of morally admirable partiality altogether or hold that any apparent cases are in fact ultimately reducible to impartial standards see section Thus impartialists hold that contrary perhaps to appearances impartiality is indeed a pervasive and universal requirement of morality Rather than being put in terms of an impartial point of view the relation between morality and impartiality is sometimes made out in terms of an impartial agent or observer a person who makes moral judgments without being influenced by the sort of contaminating biases or prejudices that tend to arise from the occupation of some particular point of view Smith Hume Firth Brandt Hare We should note that this idea is not always clearly distinguished from the conception based on the impartial point of view Smith for instance seems to advance them both at once in claiming that the ideal observer simply is the observer who occupies the impartial point of view The observer may also be defined as ideal in various other ways It is generally stipulated that she is in possession of all the nonmoral facts that are relevant to the judgments she has to make Firth It is also fairly common to assume that she is an ideal reasoner and thus immune to logical fallacy or mistaken inference etc Indeed Hare goes so far as to state that his archangel possesses superhuman powers of thought superhuman knowledge and no human weaknesses Hare The ideal observer theory of morality in its most straightforward form states that moral judgments simply are the judgments an ideal observer of this sort will make What must be pointed out about such a conception of morality for our purposes is that any advantage it has over the conception of morality as an impartial point of view presumably arises from the fact that the ideal observer is not completely defined in terms of impartiality If she were the two conceptions would simply coincide Yet many ideal observer theorists seem to accept a characterization of the ideal observer which concentrates on her impartiality and impersonality Firth for example suggests that the ideal observer is both distinterested in the strong sense of being entirely lacking in particular interests and dispassionate in that she is incapable of experiencing any emotions at all Firth Defined in this way however the ideal observer sounds not only impersonal but deeply indifferent and the idea that the moral judgments of a person who had neither emotional responses nor particular interests could be trusted let alone that they might be considered definitive of morality strikes some critics as highly implausible Brandt Suppose then that the ideal observer theorist decides that the definition of the ideal observer must include more than the bare idea of impartiality that in addition the observer must be say compassionate and thus not indifferent and that she must possess a considerable facility for proper moral judgments practical wisdom in the Aristotelian sense Such a theorist will now face a different problem the more we build into the definition of our ideal observer the less useful it becomes as a heuristic device Stipulating that the ideal observer is very wise for example is not very helpful if we ourselves are not wise and so have no idea what an ideally wise observer would choose Indeed ideal observer analyses that go too far in this direction seem to become circular the ideal observer is ideal because she always makes proper judgments those being defined as just those judgments the ideal observer would make Broad A circularity of this sort seems to be present in John Stuart Mill claim Impartiality in short as an obligation of justice may be said to mean being exclusively influenced by the considerations which it is supposed ought to influence the particular case in hand and resisting the solicitation of any motives which prompt to conduct different from what those considerations would dictate Mill see also Firth The ideal observer then to be useful must be given some independent definition and not simply defined as an agent who always gets it right The challenge of course is to find such a definition Here as with the conception of morality as defined by an impartial point of view the phenomenon of morally admirable partiality proves a particularly difficult issue Should we define the ideal observer as being loyal to her country or as being above loyalty If the former can she serve as an adequate moral example to people who do not share her allegiances If the latter how can she serve as an adequate example to anyone The persistent problem that faces the ideal observer approach to moral impartiality seems to be that any process of idealization of the sort required to make such a conception work seems likely to result in an individual so removed from the concrete lives and concerns of actual human moral agents that her moral judgments will turn out to be in large part irrelevant to the question of how such agents ought to live see Walker The moral importance of the impartial point of view is that from it every moral agent counts equally no one including the person occupying that point of view is considered to be intrinsically more significant than anyone else or to have more powerful claims to attention simply by virtue of who they are Similarly one of the primary virtues of the ideal observer seems to be that she also regards persons in this way Whatever these conceptions may get wrong then one thing they seem to get right is the idea that there is a close and important connection between moral impartiality and equality see especially Nagel Chapter Some clarification however is required To say that from the impartial point of view no one is seen as intrinsically more significant than anyone else is not to say that there is no reason whatsoever for which a person might count as more significant than others or for which a person might legitimately demand disproportionate moral attention in some circumstances Many moral theorists after all will suppose that from the impartial point of view properly conceived some individuals will count as more significant at least in certain ways William Godwin Godwin provides an influential and rather infamous example Fenelon the archbishop of Cambrai Godwin writes may be supposed to be more significant than a mere chambermaid and it follows at least according to Godwin that in the case of a fire the archbishop ought to be rescued first The reason however is not simply that the archbishop happens to be himself that is his greater significance is not supposed to be intrinsic rather the claim is grounded on the fact that the archbishop makes greater contributions to society We are not connected with one or two percipient beings but with a society a nation and in some sense with the whole family of mankind Of consequence that life ought to be preferred which will be most conducive to the general good In saving the life of Fenelon suppose at the moment when he was conceiving the project of his immortal Telemachus I should be promoting the benefit of thousands who have been cured by the perusal of it of some error vice and consequent unhappiness Nay my benefit would extend further than this for every individual thus cured has become a better member of society and has contributed in his turn to the happiness the information and improvement of mankind Godwin The claim that the archbishop is more significant then is grounded on what are essentially universal properties if the chambermaid also had it in her to write Telemachus her claim to be rescued would be just as great Fenelon claim to priority is not based on his intrinsic significance In Godwin mind the fact that one individual has a greater claim to rescue than the other is not only not in conflict with impartiality but indeed is implied by impartiality for it is based on the alleged fact that an impartial judgment of their worth attributes more to one than to the other Thus viewing persons from an impartial point of view need not imply that we view them equally in every sense of the word and it certainly does not imply that everyone must receive equal treatment In Godwin Archbishop Fenelon if we assume that only one person can be saved the only way to give the archbishop and the chambermaid equal treatment would be to let them both perish in the flames What impartiality seems to require is not that everyone receive equal treatment but rather that everyone be treated as an equal Dworkin While the distinction between equal treatment and treatment as equals is difficult to make out with precision the main idea is fairly clear treatment as equals requires that persons are not treated equally but rather treated in accordance with what rights they possess what legitimate claims they put forward and in general with what they deserve Thus to inflict a one year jail sentence on all accused persons regardless of whether they are guilty or innocent is to provide equal treatment to members of that group but it is not to treat them as equals Whether or not moral impartiality obliges us to see the archbishop as having a greater claim to be rescued is of course controversial Moreover Godwin asserts two even more controversial claims in connection with the Archbishop Fenelon example The first is that the chambermaid herself ought to have perceived the greater significance of the archbishop and so should have sacrificed her own life for his were that necessary The second is that any other person even the child or husband of the chambermaid ought to have been willing to make the same sacrifice Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife my mother or my benefactor That would not alter the truth of the proposition The life of Fenelon would still be more valuable than that of the chambermaid and justice pure unadulterated justice would still have preferred that which was most valuable Justice would have taught me to save the life of Fenelon at the expense of the other What magic is there in the pronoun my to overturn the decisions of everlasting truth My wife or my mother may be a fool or a prostitute malicious lying or dishonest If they be what consequence is it that they are mine Godwin pp Whether this extreme position really is required either by moral impartiality or by the demand that we treat people as equals is a matter of great dispute not only between partialists and impartialists but within the impartialist camp itself If nothing else Godwin position is quite clearly incompatible with the apparent existence of morally admirable partiality Williams holds that even to consider sacrificing one wife for the sake of impersonal justice constitutes a kind of moral error in its own right Moreover despite the fact that the ultimate evaluation is made on the grounds of perfectly general properties it is not entirely clear that the objects of the evaluation really are being treated as equals in the relevant sense the fact that the chambermaid life is to be sacrificed for the overall good at least suggests that her standing as a moral being is not really being taken into account and that the suggested understanding of moral impartiality is therefore deficient Indeed John Taurek has famously argued that the various goods of individual persons cannot be added up to a total overall good in any meaningful sense and that the traditional consequentialist conception of right action as maximizing the overall good is incoherent indeed Taurek claims such decision making actually fail to show equal respect for all persons concerned Taurek denial that one can aggregate various individual goods can be regarded as a strong version of the Rawlsian claim that morality must respect a distinction between persons Suppose a lifeguard must choose between saving one drowning person or saving five whomever she chooses not to save will drown and she cannot save both groups Most consequentialists and many others would take it as obvious that at least in the absence of very special circumstances the solitary drowner being the potential author of Telemachus for instance the five should be saved rather than the one But to assume this Taurek argues would be to fail to show the one the same respect one shows the five after all this response leaves the single victim no chance at all of being rescued Taurek controversial suggestion is that the lifeguard would show equal respect by flipping a coin as this would every person involved an equal chance fifty percent of being rescued Not surprisingly Taurek in famous argument has engendered a substantial amount of discussion and criticism see for instance Kamm Chapters Kavka Otsuka Parfit Consequentialist moral theories hold that moral evaluations and justifications must ultimately be grounded in the value of the consequences of the actions rules policies strategies character traits etc that are being evaluated Hooker That is the ultimate question to be asked of any action rule or character trait under evaluation is Does it the action rule or trait in question promote the good For the purposes of this entry three important assumptions will be made regarding consequentialist theories First consequentialist theories will be assumed to hold that the overall values of sets of consequences can be determined and thus ranked independently of the identity of any particular agent thus we can speak of the best consequences without having to ask best relative to whom Second such theories will be assumed to hold that the impersonal good the overall value of some particular state of affairs is largely if not entirely composed of the interests of individual persons and that the interests of each person count for just as much as those of every other person Finally it will be assumed that we are dealing with act consequentialist theories theories that is which hold that the consequentialist standard is to be applied directly to the actions of agents and that what is required is that every action or overall pattern of action maximize the impersonal good Such a theory then requires that every agent always choose an action that will bring about consequences at least as good as those that would be brought about by any other available action We should in so characterizing consequentialism I am defining it as operating on the second level identified by Brad Hooker in Hooker the level that is of direct action One might instead adhere to a theory according to which first order moral rules should be chosen in accordance with their tendency to promote the overall good impartially conceived Such theories typically go by the name rule consequentialism though there has been some debate as to whether they constitute genuinely consequentialist theories at all Howard Snyder For the purposes of understanding impartiality at any rate it is most useful to group rule consequentialist theories not with act consequentialist theories but with deontological theories which are more similar in terms of their underlying normative structure As we are understanding it then consequentialism seems to place each agent under a pervasive obligation to be strictly impartial between all persons by requiring her always to exclude from her practical deliberations almost all considerations that do not bear directly on the ways in which people interests might be advanced or injured by her actions The consequentialist standard then is strictly impartial in a very direct manner and in a very rigorous sense A consequentialist agent is not permitted to prefer herself nor any of her loved ones in choosing a distribution of benefits and burdens She may not accept a pleasure for herself if doing so involves passing up the opportunity to bring about a slightly larger pleasure for a stranger Nor is she permitted to feed her own children if she could do more good by feeding hungrier strangers instead She must sacrifice the life of a spouse parent or child if by doing so she would save more lives or even save the life of one other person whose contribution to the overall good would be greater than that of the person sacrificed Recall Godwin Archbishop Fenelon case discussed in section It is for reasons such as this that consequentialist impartiality is accused of being too demanding By refusing to allow the agent personal concerns to play a special role in her practical deliberations it is claimed consequentialism threatens her integrity and alienates her from herself and others Kapur Scheffler Stocker Williams As Brian Barry has written the effect of consequentialist impartiality is in effect to extend to the whole of conduct the requirements of impartiality that on the common sense view are restricted to judges and bureaucrats acting in their official capacities Barry The kind of impartiality that features in consequentialist theories then seems to be much more pervasive and much more severe than that recommended by common sense morality The fact that consequentialist impartiality turns out to have such strict and demanding implications is for the consequentialist a double edged sword On the one hand there is no doubt that consequentialism is a deeply impartial moral theory on the plausible and popular assumption that a moral theory must be deeply impartial consequentialism meets this criterion with flying colors And consequentialists have typically been adept at exploiting this fact with powerful rhetoric Godwin famous query what magic is there in the pronoun my being a noteworthy example On the other hand the impartial demands of consequentialism are so strict and so extreme that some critics have found them unacceptable consequentialism they claim simply demands too much and must therefore be rejected Scheffler Slote Williams Essentially this worry is a version of what we referred to above as the problem of morally admirable partiality The common sense view is that it is permissible for an agent to be partial toward herself that is to treat her own projects and concerns as if they had special significance Scheffler From her point of view of course they do have special significance This sort of self concern then constitutes a form of partiality which seems from the vantage point of common sense to be morally endorsed Similarly certain sorts of partiality directed toward other people friends family members and the like are also forbidden by consequentialist impartiality but regarded as justifiable and in many cases admirable from the standpoint of common sense Blum Cottingham Kekes Slote Defenders of consequentialism generally respond in one of three ways First a consequentialist might argue that any genuinely impartial moral theory will make extreme demands of agents Second they might argue that the view that consequentialism is excessively demanding depends on a false theory of practical reasoning which accords too much significance to morality Third they might argue that in fact the demands of consequentialism are not as extreme as have been supposed The first strategy faces a severe difficulty namely it at least seems to be the case that certain non consequentialist moral theories in particular deontological theories also incorporate impartial elements in a fundamental manner and yet make demands on the moral agent which are considerably less extreme than those of consequentialism Thus while some consequentialists Brink have argued that the truth of consequentialism can be logically derived more or less directly from the requirement that morality be impartial this seems to be a mistake Scheffler pp Of course it is open to the consequentialist either to deny that deontological moral theories are genuinely impartial Kagan Scheffler or to argue that properly understood any plausible ethical theory will be seen to make demands comparable to those made by consequentialism Brink Ashford Both of these strategies however face difficulties as we will see in section there is in fact a very strong case in favor of viewing at least some deontological theories as genuinely and fundamentally impartial a case which nevertheless does not prohibit us from viewing such theories as less demanding than their consequentialist rivals The second strategy is to argue that those who object to consequentialism on the grounds that it is too demanding are placing too much importance on the role of morality in practical reasoning Brink Wolf If moral considerations dominated practical reasoning if that is they were the only or at any rate by far the most significant considerations in determining our actions then consequentialism would be untenable on account of its demanding too much A proper perspective on practical reasoning however reveals that moral demands constitute only one set of demands among many When put in their proper place then in the larger scheme of practical reasons and requirements the extreme demands of consequentialist morality will no longer seem threatening To borrow a pair of phrases from David Brink what appear to be moral worries about the tendency of consequentialism to make excessive moral demands might really be worries about morality worries that is about whether or not we have reason to act as morality requires Whether the view of morality presupposed by this strategy is true however is questionable at the very least it does not seem to be the case that the majority of those who have defended consequentialism as a normative theory of ethics have intended it to be viewed as a theory that could be frequently or easily overridden Jollimore Chapter see also Peter Railton Richard Miller Chapter The third strategy is perhaps the best known and most frequently employed It is argued that given a reasonable and accurate view of human nature and the abilities of agents it will be seen that what consequentialism requires is not a radically different sort of life from the one most of us currently live rather consequentialism will require in most cases at least only reasonable and relatively minor adjustments in our current lifestyles In particular it is argued that consequentialism permits the agent both to give preference to her own projects and concerns and to favor particular other individuals friends family members etc and that all this is consistent with the agent having as her overriding project the maximizing of the good The locus classicus of this argument is found in Mill Utilitarianism The objectors to utilitarianism cannot always be charged with representing it in a discreditable light On the contrary those among them who entertain anything like a just idea of its disinterested character sometimes find fault with its standard as being too high for humanity They say it is exacting too much to require that people shall always act from the inducement of promoting the general interests of society But this is to mistake the very meaning of a standard of morals and to confound the rule of action with the motive of it The great majority of good actions are intended not for the benefit of the world but for that of individuals of which the good of the world is made up and the thoughts of the most virtuous man need not on these occasions travel beyond the particular persons concerned except so far as is necessary to assure himself that in benefiting them he is not violating the rights that is the legitimate and authorized expectations of any one else The multiplication of happiness is according to the utilitarian ethics the object of virtue the occasions on which any person except one in a thousand has it in his power to do this on an extended scale in other words to be a public benefactor are but exceptional and on these occasions alone is he called on to consider public utility in every other case private utility the interest or happiness of some few persons is all he has to attend to Mill pp Similarly Godwin argues that True wisdom will recommend to us individual attachments since it is the object of virtue to produce happiness and since the man who lives in the midst of domestic relations will have many opportunities of conferring pleasure minute in the detail yet not trivial in the amount Quoted in Cannold et al This position it will be noted appears to be in some amount of tension with the more extreme consequentialist position attributed to Godwin in section More recent versions of this argument follow Mill basic strategy Peter Railton argues that a sophisticated consequentialist will develop patterns of decision making that do not except on rare occasions refer explicitly to consequentialist aims and goals and that both the psychology and the outward behavior of such an individual will be similar to that of the typical non consequentialist Similarly Frank Jackson argues that the most efficient strategy for a dedicated consequentialist is to concentrate on small groups of particular persons rather than trying to promote the well being of humanity at large and that this will involve the formation of close personal relationships with other individuals Others who have deployed versions of this argument include Bales Brink and Pettit Brennan The evaluation of this consequentialist strategy is a difficult issue Consequentialists are surely correct to point out that obsessive consequentialist strategizing is likely at a certain point to turn counter productive and that a consequentialist agent is therefore well advised to develop more moderate approaches On the other hand Mill and many other consequentialists seem to underestimate the amount of good that a dedicated consequentialist agent might be able to contribute and thus to underestimate the amount of good that she will be required to contribute Moreover our powers to influence the lives of strangers have increased considerably since Mill day As Susan Wolf writes his argument is simply unconvincing in light of the empirical circumstances of our world The gain in happiness that would accrue to oneself and one neighbors by a more well rounded richer life than that of the moral saint would be pathetically small in comparison to the amount by which one could increase the general happiness if one devoted oneself explicitly to the care of the sick the downtrodden the starving and the homeless Wolf see also Singer Moreover while a theory such as Railton sophisticated consequentialism can acknowledge that a sophisticated consequentialist agent might sometimes knowingly bring about less than maximally good consequences such a theory must nonetheless continue to insist that each particular act of doing so is indeed morally wrong an insistence which seems contrary to our moral intuitions Jollimore It is not clear then that an appeal to the limits of human powers can succeed in converting what is after all a fundamentally radical moral theory into a comfortably conservative one In addition to claiming that consequentialist impartiality is too demanding many critics have also argued that it is too permissive Since consequentialism makes the permissibility of an action entirely dependent on the value of that action consequences it follows that there is no type of action that can be prohibited on consequentialist grounds except of course for that type which is defined explicitly in terms of sub optimal consequences Thus instances of torture premeditated murder rape and other violations of fundamental human rights are at least potentially justifiable on a consequentialist basis no such action can be ruled out morally speaking until the comparative value of the state of affairs it will bring about has been determined The effect of this complaint like the previous one is not to deny the claim that consequentialism is a deeply impartial moral theory but rather to suggest that it incorporates the wrong sort of impartiality Suppose to take an example common in the literature that consequentialism recommends that an man be convicted of and punished for a crime he did not commit in order to prevent the public from rioting McCloskey Such an action would according to common intuitions constitute a gross violation of justice and it seems a weak reply to point out that the recommendation was arrived at through an impartial calculation a calculation that took the interests of every individual including the framed man into equal account For while the claim is strictly speaking true there is nevertheless a clear and compelling case in favor of concluding that the framed man was not treated impartially in the sense that ought to matter here We expect a judicial system to allocate punishments in accordance with degree of guilt not in accordance with the expected value to society of the consequences in each case and the fact that both methods constitute forms of impartial decision making does not imply that they are equally morally acceptable Again the classic response to this objection dates back to Mill Utilitarianism If institutions of justice are to be given a general justification Mill argues this justification must find its ultimate grounding in utility to society for what else could explain why justice is valued at all other than the fact that it serves and protects our interests But since a justice system will only succeed in this role if it is governed by common principles of justice principles including for instance that only the guilty should be punished and that the punishment ought to be proportional to the crime it follows that such principles are not opposed to consequentialism at all Rather at the deepest justificatory level consequentialism and the demands of justice coincide The claim that such a coincidence generally obtains is probably easy to establish The challenge for Mill and for other consequentialists arises in those particular cases in which the coincidence fails Assuming that the possibility of such cases does not move one to simply abandon consequentialism in favor of some more justice friendly conception such as the rule consequentialism Mill himself sometimes seems to find attractive there are two general defense strategies for consequentialists to employ The first strategy argues that there are good consequentialist reasons for being the sort of agent who respects the dictates of justice even in cases in which the coincidence between the demands of justice and those of consequentialism fails Pettit cf Railton The second strategy admits that there are cases in which unjust actions can be given a consequentialist justification but holds that when so much as it stake justice must give way to consequentialism demands Smart Kagan Pettit Whether either approach is sufficient given the apparent depth and force of our common intuitions about the requirements of justice is a matter of ongoing debate In section we noted that while consequentialist impartiality is one possible interpretation of the demand that morality be impartial it is not by any means the only available interpretation nor is it clearly the most plausible The considerations related to justice discussed in section may help us to appreciate this For consider once more the position of the framed innocent whose fundamental interests have been sacrificed for the sake of the greater good Such a person may well complain that he has not been treated impartially in the appropriate sense for while it is true that his interests were counted in determining the nature of the overall good it is nevertheless also true that ultimately he became the victim of a form of abuse that was both harsh and undeserved The framed innocent might also back up his complaint by making the plausible claim that had he been in a position to choose he would never have consented to a moral system that allowed anyone to be accorded such treatment Thus while there is a sense in which his interests were counted equally there is another and very important sense in which his interests and perhaps more importantly his claims and rights do not seem to have received full or adequate consideration at all Deontologists insist that consequentialism errs by failing to accord proper significance to the moral agent as an individual in John Rawls words consequentialism does not take seriously the distinction between persons Rawls section Rawls has utilitarianism in particular as his target but the point applies more widely Similarly Samuel Scheffler has suggested that for human beings as creatures with values the normative force of certain forms of partiality is nearly unavoidable If that is right then for morality to reject partiality in a general or systematic way would be for it to set itself against our nature as valuing creatures And that I believe would make morality an incoherent enterprise Scheffler It should be noted that Scheffler ultimate conclusion that morality itself actually incorporates reasons of partiality in the sense that such reasons bear directly on the rightness or wrongness of actions would rule out not only straightforwardly act consequentialist theories but many though not all types of deontological theory as well Thus the fact that consequentialist impartiality makes extraordinary and to many unreasonable demands on the individual section might be taken to indicate that consequentialism fails to take individuals seriously as agents At the same time the fact that consequentialist impartiality permits the individual to be used as a mere means when doing so promotes the greater good section might indicate that consequentialism fails to take individuals seriously as patients The conception of impartiality that tends to be favored by deontologists avoids such implications by refusing to view impartial action simply as a matter of maximizing interests or some other version of the impersonally determined good Indeed deontologists take the right rather than the good to be fundamental to ethics and tend to see moral action in terms of acting in accordance with principles that are rationally acceptable to all Exactly what these principles are and exactly what method should be used to determine them are matters of some disagreement among deontological theorists But there does seem to be a general consensus among deontologists that moral impartiality does not require that an agent be strictly neutral between her own good and the good of other people in ordinary decision making contexts Rather an agent is permitted on deontological views to give special attention to her own projects and interests An important distinction can be drawn here between first order and second order impartiality Barry see also Hooker First order impartiality is that displayed by an agent in ordinary choice situations choosing how to spend one day who to spend time with and so forth Second order impartiality by contrast operates only in a certain special sort of context contexts in which the rules principles and institutions which govern first order behavior are evaluated and selected Thus a moral rule granting individuals complete freedom of association and thus allowing them to display first order partiality by spending time with whomever they please regardless of whether doing so promotes the greater social good in any particular case might be given a second order impartialist justification by demonstrating that such a rule would promote the impersonal good or that it would be selected by a group of impartial persons who were choosing the moral rules that were to govern society The fact that deontological theories generally permit some degree of first order partiality that is that agents are permitted to pay special attention to their own interests projects and loved ones should not then be taken to imply either that the agent interests are objectively more valuable than those of other persons or that the agent is justified in viewing them as such Rather the deontologist will claim it reflects the fact that it is morally legitimate perhaps again because justifiable in second order impartialist terms for an agent to regard her own goals and interests as especially important to her Thus deontological moral systems tend to incorporate an irreducible element of agent relativity of a sort that consequentialist theories cannot embody Nagel McNaughton Rawling Jollimore The incorporation of agent relativity of this sort into deontological theories allows such theories to escape the most straightforward versions of the claim that they demand too much of moral agents Nevertheless various versions of that objection have been leveled against deontological theories It has been claimed for instance that Kantianism by insisting that only actions performed out of the motive of duty have moral worth delegitimizes or even forbids the type of motives which typically and perhaps necessarily operate in the context of close personal relationships Stocker Williams Typically Kantians have responded by distancing themselves from the view that only actions motivated by duty have value and acknowledging instead that a commitment to duty need only function as a limiting condition rather than as the primary source of motivation in all cases Baron The Kantian account of moral value of course is not essential to deontological theories and those theories which eschew it may well be able to avoid the demandingness objection altogether On many deontological views particularly Kantian ones the significance of moral impartiality is seen as arising from the fact that a core role is given to the concept of universalizability Gert Hare Kant Kohlberg The requirement that moral judgments be universalizable is roughly the requirement that such judgments be independent of any particular point of view Thus an agent who judges that A ought morally to do in situation ought to be willing to endorse the same judgment whether she herself happens to be A or some other individual involved in the situation someone who perhaps will be directly affected by A actions or an entirely neutral observer Her particular identity is completely irrelevant in the determination of the correctness or appropriateness of the judgment Universalizability thus formulated does imply at least one sort of impartiality an agent whose judgments are universalizable will be morally consistent in the sense that she will judge her own actions by the same standards she applies to others Such an agent will not make an exception of herself by allowing herself to break a rule she regards as binding for others or to perform any other action which she would not accept if performed by another agent Impartiality of this sort however does not necessarily imply any sort of impartiality with respect to other individuals interests rights or claims On a minimally demanding interpretation of the universalizability requirement the judgments made by a person whose conception of the good was intrinsically racist that is a person who held that the well being of members of some one particular race mattered more or less objectively speaking than the well being of members of other races could very well turn out to be universalizable so long as the racist held that his judgments were objectively correct and so ought to be assented to by all individuals including those individuals who would be disadvantaged by the general adoption of those views cf Gewirth Gert Chapter Wiggins Williams However the conclusion that the racist judgments are universalizable presupposes a very minimal account of what universalizability requires On this account it requires only that an agent be sincerely committed to the objectivity of his judgments in the sense that he views them from his current perspective as correct from all perspectives and thus as calling for everyone assent whether or not that assent is actually given There are two ways of making the universalizability requirement more demanding The first is to appeal to certain counterfactual claims about what the agent would endorse if he actually did occupy various perspectives On this view a particular judgment by A is universalizable if and only if A endorses that judgment from his current perspective and would endorse the same judgment from any other perspective Given this understanding of universalizability it is much less likely indeed extraordinarily unlikely that racist views will turn out to be universalizable for it is not generally true of individuals that they would endorse the view The well being of members of race matters less than the well being of members of other races if they themselves were members of race However such a view may well require too much for there are few if any moral judgments or principles that would be endorsed from every perspective any given agent might occupy A different approach to universalizability eschews the appeal to psychological facts altogether and holds that whether or not a particular judgment is universalizable is a logical fact rather than a psychological one Kant categorical imperative test for example holds that universalizability is the distinguishing feature of correct moral judgments and that a judgment is universalizable if and only if it can without contradiction be willed as a universal practical law Kant Since the test hinges on whether the willing of a judgment as a universal law results in a contradiction it follows that whether or not a judgment is universalizable in this way is a matter of practical reason and does not depend on which particular individual will happens to be involved The types of impartiality implied by both of these more demanding versions of the universalizability requirement are likely to be considerably more substantial than the formal consistency required by the minimal version Kant for instance seems to hold that universalizability implies a certain level of altruism or charity in the form of the imperfect duties we owe towards other individuals There are problems however with Kant argument for this In particular it is not clear just how the universal willing of a maxim such as When others are in need of help I always ignore their needs give rise to any sort of contradiction It is true of course that were we actually in a position to choose the universal maxims on which all rational persons would act this would be a poor choice for we might someday be in need of assistance from another But to say that the willing of this maxim as a universal law would be imprudent is not to say that doing so is contradictory Moreover as David Wiggins points out certain other actions that seem as if they ought to be morally permissible the act for instance of releasing a debtor from his debt out of generosity have maxims that seem to fail the universalizability test so conceived These examples may point to a general problem with the attempt to derive impartiality from universalizability whereas the latter at least on a Kantian interpretation is a formal property of moral judgments moral impartiality as we have seen is a substantive rather than a formal concept See Herman and Korsgaard for attempts to respond to these problems It should be mentioned that some moral theorists have attempted to derive various versions of consequentialist impartiality more or less directly from the universalizability requirement Hare Pettit see also Harsanyi However the claim that a conception of impartiality that is not only substantive but also extraordinarily demanding can be derived from a requirement which as just pointed out is essentially a formal one continues to strike a majority of moral philosophers as dubious The requirement that moral judgements be universalizable seems to reflect two fundamental moral insights first that morality is objective and not simply a matter of personal opinion or expression of interest and desire and second that from the standpoint of morality each person matters just as much as and no more than any other person The contractualist approach to moral theorizing provides one method of giving expression to these fundamental ideas about morality Contractualism borrows from the social contract tradition the idea that morality may be viewed as the result of an agreement between those who are to be bound by its dictates Two variants of this approach can be distinguished The former sometimes referred to as contractarianism identifies the participants in the bargaining process with actual individuals and thus is broadly historical The latter approach by contrast appeals to what agents would choose under various quite possibly unrealizable conditions and is thus hypothetical rather than historical It is the latter approach that will concern us here The hypothetical contractualist model then regards moral principles as the result of a bargaining process among a group of agents subject to certain restrictions that are specified so as to guarantee that the chosen principles will meet the demands of second order impartiality The most famous example of this approach is John Rawls veil of ignorance as described in Rawls According to Rawls the principles of a just society are those that would be chosen by self interested rational agents in the original position a position in which agents possess broad knowledge about human history and the nature of the world they live in but are denied specific information regarding their own particular identities or prospects in the society in question the nature of that society and crucially the nature of their own particular conception of the good Since nobody knows who they will be or what social position they will occupy there is no opportunity for anyone in an advantaged position to take advantage of that position in order to force a less privileged party to concede to an otherwise unacceptable outcome It is this fact that allows Rawls to claim that principles chosen under the veil of ignorance are guaranteed to be impartially acceptable to all and thus guaranteed not to be unjust It should be noted that Rawls does not intend that morality in its entirely be derived from the original position Rather the function of the original position is limited to the choice of the most general principles of social justice in a well ordered society Rawls section section Nevertheless Rawls mechanism is intended to draw the broad outlines of what many see as the most important part of morality its public or political aspect By viewing political morality as the result of an agreement between contractors limited by the strictures of the veil of ignorance Rawls intends to develop a political philosophy that reflects his commitment to the idea of liberal neutrality the idea that is that each person has a private right to her own conception of the good and that particular conceptions of the good therefore ought not to be legislatively instituted nor legislated against An especially difficult task attending a project of this sort is that of determining what shape this political morality will take that is determining which principles would be chosen by agents in the original position On Rawls account the contractors settle on principles that guaranteed as much liberty as possible for all and within the limits set by this guarantee a roughly egalitarian distribution of goods in which inequalities are allowed only if they are to the benefit of the worst off Rawls section Part II The claim that such principles would recognize all persons as equals and thus their claim to reflect the demands of moral impartiality is supported by several considerations of which three are perhaps most significant first that all persons are guaranteed equal and substantial civil liberties second that the resulting allocation of resources is broadly egalitarian and in particular ensures so far as is possible that the fundamental needs of all persons are met and third that since the only inequalities that are permitted are those that would benefit the least advantaged it can presumably be assumed that the least advantaged would give their assent to the existence of such inequalities they would not even if they could veto the system In Rawls scheme the function of the veil of ignorance is necessary to prevent rational self interested persons from using their knowledge of their own positions to win unfair advantages over others Whether such an approach can provide genuine impartiality between competing conceptions of the good is a difficult question that will be further considered in section An alternative approach abandons both the veil of ignorance and the assumption that the bargaining parties are primarily self interested This is the strategy favored by Scanlon whose contractors are motivated not by self interest but by the desire for reasonable agreement Scanlon see also Scanlon Barry On the resulting account of moral permissibility an act is wrong if its performance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any system of rules for the general regulation of behavior which no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed unforced general agreement Scanlon The requirement of impartiality is captured here by the basic fact that the question is whether everyone who is to live under the selected rules can reasonably accept them As in Rawls theory however the principles of second order impartiality accepted at the contract level allow for considerable first order partiality at the level of agent choice Harsanyi argues that a version of utilitarianism can be defended on the basis of an equiprobability model according to which an agent ought to choose between social systems under the assumption that in either system he would have the same probability of occupying any one of the available social positions Harsanyi cf Hare Gert argues for a list of moral rules which all impartial rational persons would favor including as part of the moral system Gauthier defends a contemporary version of contractarianism Traditional conceptions of impartiality such as those we have been discussing face a variety of objections Many of these objections focus on the claim that such conceptions take insufficient account of the nature of the moral agent and of the pragmatics of the situations in which impartial decisions are actually made Along these lines some objectors claim that traditional conceptions set the bar too high demanding superhuman abilities or cognitive efforts from moral agents Others meanwhile concentrate on the fact that the traditional conceptions tend to identify impartiality with an unemotional dispassionate disposition or to otherwise characterize it in impersonal or otherwise negative terms in terms that is of what the moral agent lacks rather than what she possesses Two other types of objection are particularly troubling for liberal theorists The first argues that by restricting impartiality within the bounds of individual societies liberal theory tends to fall short of the level of impartiality actually demanded by morality The second objection here questions whether the liberal conception of impartiality can remain genuinely neutral between competing conceptions of the good We shall examine these objections in turn The first charge that impartiality as conceived by traditional ethical theories makes extraordinary and unreasonable cognitive demands on moral agents must be distinguished from the objection to consequentialist impartiality considered earlier which claimed that the sacrifices demanded by consequentialist impartiality were unreasonable and excessive The objection now being considered is not that impartiality asks the agent to give up too much but rather that the cognitive feats demanded by these moral theories will exceed the capacity of the typical moral agent Indeed one popular version of this objection alleges that an agent will require an unreasonable amount of knowledge or cognitive ability simply to be able to identify what the demands of impartiality are Friedman Walker Given the conception of the impartial point of view as a God eye point of view for example Baier it seems questionable whether it is ever reasonable to expect a human moral agent to be able to occupy such a perspective God quite obviously possesses far more knowledge than does any human being moreover God point of view is both objective and impersonal in ways that an individual human perspective cannot be As Margaret Urban Walker points out it is often said that human beings have to live with their decisions but it sounds very odd to say that of God Walker Similar remarks apply to the conception of the impartial point of view as the point of view of the universe Sidgwick to Hare conception of the ideal moral agent as a so called archangel Hare and Walker claims to Firth conception of the ideal impartial observer Firth Similarly Marilyn Friedman points out that even if a person did manage to occupy such a point of view for a period of time supposing such a thing to be possible there would be no way to confirm that she had successfully done so standard conceptions of impartiality she claims prescribe methods of normative thinking which represent psychological and epistemic feats the achievement of which we have no independent way to confirm Friedman The second objection finds fault with the traditional tendency to define impartiality in negative or abstract terms in terms that is of which elements must be absent from the psychology of the agent or which we must pretend are absent in the process of idealization Henberg for instance claims that most if not all procedural accounts of impartiality confuse it with distinterest or impersonality and thus ultimately with indifference It should be noted that many impartialists are quite explicit about the link between morality impartiality and the lack of emotion Baier for instance writes that the moral point of view is that of an independent unbiased impartial objective dispassionate disinterested observer see also Firth Similarly Richard Brandt argues that it is a mistake to define moral impartiality with reference to an ideal observer who is defined as among other things distinterested for after all it is not clear that a purely disinterested being would support a moral system at all Brandt While Brandt complaint is particularly directed at the ideal observer theory of Firth this objection seems to apply much more broadly it is obvious for instance that Rawls veil of ignorance is designed precisely to prevent the contractors from acting in an interested manner The problem is not only that impersonal persons of this sort are likely to suffer from massive indifference but also that there is alleged to be a conceptual difficulty with the very idea of conceiving impartiality in such terms An abstract or impersonal evaluator it is argued could not possibly make reliable judgments about substantive moral matters whether or not he was motivated to since he would be unable to appreciate the particular concerns of the contesting parties Both of these difficulties the motivational and the cognitive are well expressed by Iris Marion Young who rejects altogether the idea that morality is primarily a matter of impartiality The ideal of impartiality is an idealist fiction It is impossible to adopt an unsituated point of view and if a point of view is situated it cannot stand apart from and understand all points of view It is impossible to reason about substantive moral issues without understanding their substance which always presupposes some particular social and historical context and one has no motive for making moral judgments and resolving moral dilemmas unless the outcome matters unless one has a particular and passionate interest in the outcome when class race ethnicity gender sexuality and age define different social locations one subject cannot fully empathize with another in a different social location adopt her point of view if that were possible then the social locations would not be different Young pp cf Benhabib As noted above liberal theorists often tend to conceptualize impartiality using the model of a social contract If society is pictured as the result of a hypothetical agreement between persons each of whom is equally empowered to revoke the agreement then it stands to reason that the resulting set of rules must in some sense be acceptable to all and must embody in some deep way the ideal of equal respect Some have complained however that this approach risks leaving those not party to the contract out in the cold But surely it is plausible to think that a society in order to be just must not only treat and avoid treating its own citizens in certain ways but must also respect certain rules regarding its behavior towards members of other societies As Charles Jones writes Unlike Rawls I see no reason to restrict our moral focus to the basic structure of any particular nation state on the contrary if one concern is with the justifiability of the institutions which determine people life chances there are compelling grounds for taking a wider view Amartya Sen draws a distinction between open and closed impartiality which turns on whether or not the exercise of impartial assessment is confined to a fixed group Since the contractors behind the veil of ignorance are aware that they are part of a certain society and do not see themselves in any sense as representing the world as a whole the veil of ignorance represents an impartial system only in the closed sense Therefore Sen complains that As a device of structured political analysis the procedure is not geared to addressing the need to overcome group prejudices By contrast open impartiality which Sen finds recommended in the works of Adam Smith see Smith demands that the viewpoints of others whether or not belonging to some group of which one is specifically a member receive adequate attention There are various responses open to Rawlsian theorists Rawls himself suggests that we imagine a second veil of ignorance behind which representatives of various societies can meet in order to set fair and impartial ground rules for international relations Much like justice within states Rawls writes Justice between states is determined by the principles that would be chosen in the original position so interpreted These principles are political principles for they govern public policies toward other nations Rawls Such a position of course will not satisfy everyone and some critics worry that reiterating the veil of ignorance on the international level will simply reiterate its more problematic elements in a wider scale Nonetheless it is important to keep in mind that the objection here is not to impartiality itself but to a particular version of it Indeed what critics such as Sen and Jones are really claiming of course is that the framework Rawls provides is not impartial enough If genuine impartiality is an illusion as Young alleges then impartialists may be suspected in smuggling in their own substantive moral positions and biases under the guise of neutrality Rawls use of the veil of ignorance for example has been criticized by Thomas Nagel and others on the basis that by requiring that agents lack knowledge of their conceptions of the good a necessary stipulation of the bargainers are to achieve a consensus the veil of ignorance excludes from the original position information that is morally relevant and indeed may put some of the bargainers at a disadvantage The original position Nagel writes seems to presuppose not just a neutral theory of the good but a liberal individualistic conception according to which the best that can be wished for someone is the unimpeded pursuit of his own path provided it does not interfere with the rights of others Nagel see also Teitelman Schwartz Sandel Benhabib Such a conception it is held clearly does favor some conceptions of the good over others in particular atomic individualistic conceptions focusing on personal fulfillment constituted perhaps through the acquisition of consumer goods are privileged over more communal or social ideals that focus on solidarity and mutual interaction between persons Sandel cf Neill Chapter Feminist critics have paid particular attention to the ways in which liberal conceptions of neutrality and impartiality presuppose and reinforce traditional male dominated individualistic approaches to moral theory and in doing so reinforce the social status quo Gilligan Noddings Benhabib Young As Benhabib has pointed out Universalistic moral theories in the Western tradition from Hobbes to Rawls are substitutionalist in the sense that the universalism they defend is defined surreptitiously by identifying the experiences of a specific group of subjects as the paradigmatic case of the human as such These subjects are invariably white male adults who are propertied or at least professional Benhabib As a result the dominant social positions of such parties tend to be protected and even enhanced in the social and political theories resulting from such allegedly neutral liberal theories The problem of neutrality is a pressing one for liberals given the importance to their view of the thought that an impartial government must be neutral between various moral conceptions it must that is respect what Rawls calls the fact of pluralism it is essential to show that liberal impartialism does not simply represent another such moral conception or sectarian view in its own right Liberal impartialism then must turn out to be a framework that can be agreed to by all relevant parties even as they continue to disagree regarding particular substantive moral issues How is the liberal to establish this Nagel endorses what he calls epistemological restraint which holds that it can be reasonable for an individual to hold certain beliefs yet simultaneously unreasonable to attempt to decide matters of public policy on the basis of such beliefs Such beliefs which tend to be moral or religious in nature are said to be viewed differently from the inside from which standpoint they have perfect authority than from the outside from which standpoint they are regarded as questionable The difficulty as Barry and Raz have pointed out is to explain why doubts visible from the outside would not infect the internal point of view thus weakening these beliefs internal authority as well It should be noted that Nagel himself has expressed doubts about this argument in Nagel Rawls view appears to be similar to Nagel and thus subject to the same difficulty According to Rawls to endorse a view of justice is not to claim that it is true moreover the acceptability of liberal impartialism is not to be derived from its truth rather such a view will be accepted it is to be hoped because in societies of the relevant sort it will form a common element an overlapping consensus in the various competing conceptions of the good that occupy the public sphere Rawls Again the criticisms contained in Raz are especially trenchant While both Nagel and Rawls explicitly reject the idea that liberal impartialism is to be justified on the basis of skepticism toward various conceptions of the good Barry explicitly endorses this form of justification Barry emphasizes that the relevant form of skepticism does not involve eschewing one moral and religious beliefs but rather rejecting the claim to be certain of the truth of those beliefs This approach has been criticized on the basis that such skepticism itself constitutes a sectarian view and therefore is not neutral Larmore Mendus However as Barry points out the decisive issue is not whether some people would reject skepticism but whether it can reasonably be rejected and given Barry definition of skepticism its claim to resist being so rejected seems considerably stronger than the claims of the various conceptions of the good themselves which must indeed be excluded from the public sphere Although many people continue to speak of a partialist vs impartialist debate it should by now be clear that neither partialism nor impartialism unambiguously denote any single moral position at best they designate two poles of a continuum one of which attributes no moral significance to the demands of any sort of impartiality the other of which sees morality as exhausted by some version of impartiality While a somewhat general distinction can be usefully maintained it is misleading to think of the partialist impartialist debate as a dispute between two clearly defined and clearly opposed camps Deigh Barry pp Maximillian de Gaynesford goes so far as to argue that debates about partialism and impartialism thrive on tacit assumptions about the way each relates to the first person These assumptions rest on mistakes and confusions de Gaynesford Thus any general claim beginning with the words partialists or impartialists think that is bound to be both misleading and contentious In particular there is good reason to be wary of objections to impartialism which claim that all impartialists endorse extreme moral demands or that they require that practical reasoning be completely expunged of every vestige of the partial It is true of course that at least some impartialists such as Godwin have endorsed such claims But many do not Deontologists as we have seen hold impartiality to be a deep and significant element of morality but they also tend to allow for a considerable degree of first order partiality And even many consequentialists are prepared to admit the legitimacy of partial reasoning in some contexts if only on an instrumental basis It is useful then to draw a distinction between two sorts of impartialist moral theory Impartialist theories which require all agents to display first order impartiality at all times Godwin for example might be referred to as strict impartialist theories Impartialist theories which allow for some first order partiality but which nevertheless insist that all such behavior be justified in second order impartialist terms might be referred to as fundamentally impartialist moral theories The class of fundamentally impartial theories will include not only contractualist Kantian and rule consequentialist theories but also certain act consequentialist theories Railton which allow the practice of first order partiality as a means of promoting the impersonal good Such theories allow for partiality that is permissible justifiable and perhaps even admirable in moral terms At the same time however they insist that all such partiality is ultimately reducible that is justifiable in impartialist terms at some deeper level Within the partialist camp a strict partialist might be defined as holding that no sort of impartiality plays any moral role whatsoever a logically possible but uncommon position A moderate partialist by contrast would admit that impartiality of some sort plays a moral role but deny that this role encompasses or grounds all of morality in particular such a figure would be committed to the existence in some contexts at least of irreducible morally admirable partiality A virtue theorist for instance might make a significant place for impartiality by selecting it as one of the virtues but a virtue of this sort would presumably have to compete with other deeply partialist virtues such as loyalty which would override impartiality in at least some contexts To the extent that a deep issue between partialists and impartialists can be identified it is presumably the question of whether irreducible morally admirable partiality does indeed exist and it is along this line of dispute that the debate seems likeliest to continue Whether this debate is identical to the so called justice care debate as contended in Cannold et al is questionable though it is undeniable that there are important parallels However this way of classifying the disputants and of characterizing the issue itself is meant to be suggestive rather than definitive The fact remains that there are many types of partialist theories and many types of impartialist ones and that continuing to speak of the partialist impartialist debate in loose and imprecise terms is more likely to obscure than to illuminate Commonsense morality agrees with most deontological theories that personal relationships involve various forms of morally admirable partiality Until now most philosophers who have examined this phenomenon have focused on practical obligations the ways in which we are obligated to treat our friends and relatives better than we treat people whom we do not know and to whom we are not significantly related Disagreements regarding the extent and nature of such practical obligations have dominated the partialist impartialist debate Recently however a number of philosophers have focused their attention on a second sort of obligation we seem to have to friends and relatives In addition to treating them differently commonsense thought seems to hold that we ought to adopt different patterns of belief formation and evaluation with respect to them patterns of belief formation and evaluation that make it more likely that we will think highly of them and regard them in a positive light Thus it has been suggested that friendship and similar relationships involve epistemic partiality there are forms of epistemic bias which are recommended and possibly required by such relationships As Simon Keller has written when good friends form beliefs about each other they sometimes respond to considerations that have to do with the needs and interests of their friends not with aiming at the truth and that this is part of what makes them good friends Keller Similarly Sarah Stroud has argued that when it is a friend behavior that is in question rather than that of a stranger we tend to devote more energy to defeating or minimizing the impact of unfavorable data than we otherwise would A the end of the day we are simply less likely to conclude that our friend acted disreputably or that he is a bad person than we would in the case of a nonfriend Stroud pp As both Keller and Stroud point out these are not simply descriptions of typical friendship behavior rather they seem to be generally accepted as requirements of friendship If so and if it really is true that epistemic partiality makes us less likely to form true beliefs but see Jollimore for a challenge to this claim then we seem to face a difficult choice we must either accept that forming true beliefs is not the only goal with respect to which epistemic standards should be evaluated or else accept that the requirements of friendship and other forms of love can conflict with the requirements of epistemic rationality being an ideal epistemic agent that is is not always compatible with being an ideal friend Background There are significant discussions of conscience among the Stoics if not before Using a broad definition of conscience as a form of moral self awareness Richard Sorabji claims that the notion of conscience can be found in the Fifth Century BCE playwrights as well as in the writings of Plato and Aristotle See chapters one and two of his Moral Conscience Throughout the Ages Seneca the Younger discusses conscience in his Epistulae Morales and attributes several qualities to it St Paul discusses conscience in various letters I Corinthians Romans Hebrews Timothy Whatever the influence of Seneca and St Paul might be on subsequent discussions of conscience and synderesis late medieval discussions of conscience derive from Peter Lombard presentation of the concepts of conscience and synderesis in his Sentences Lombard cites a passage from St Jerome interpreting Ezekiel vision of four living creatures coming out of a cloud Each creature was shaped like a man but each had four faces the front face was human the right was that of a lion the left was that of an ox and the back was that of an eagle Ezekiel Jerome identifies the human face as representing the rational part of man the lion as the emotional the ox as the appetitive and the eagle as that which the Greeks call synteresis that spark of conscience which was not even extinguished in the breast of Cain after he was turned out of paradise and by which we discern that we sin when we are overcome by pleasures or frenzy and meanwhile are misled by an imitation of reason Jerome comment that synteresis alternatively synderesis is never extinguished in human beings and his remarks elsewhere to the effect that wicked people do cease to have any conscience led Lombard and subsequent thinkers to distinguish synderesis from conscience While it is unclear that Jerome meant to distinguish the two the distinction plays a major role in late medieval discussions of conscience In these discussions constant reference was made to certain works by Plato and Aristotle Neither Plato nor Aristotle explicitly mention conscience however It is their discussions of the virtues practical wisdom and weakness of will that form the critical backdrop to medieval discussions of conscience These discussions were heavily influenced by Augustine modification of these classical authors For example Augustine championed Plato notion of the unity of the virtues but he argued that love of God provided the unity to them Moreover he claimed that what pagan authors regarded as virtues were in fact vices unless they were developed for the love of God Two distinct views about the relationship between conscience and synderesis emerged in the late Middle Ages The first view a voluntaristic one can be identified with Franciscan thinkers like Bonaventure The second most clearly expounded by Aquinas is an intellectualistic view Both seem to derive from Philip the Chancellor treatise on conscience In his treatise Philip chiefly discusses synderesis and at times he describes it as an unerring intellectual dispositional potentiality that provides general truths to conscience for specific application At other times he describes synderesis as the desire for the good and it is equated with emotional reactions when one follows evil instead of good This latter description fits well with Bonaventure views on synderesis and conscience Bonaventure Bonaventure discusses both in his Commentary on the Sentences Book II distinction He places conscience squarely within the rational faculty specifying that it is part of practical reason since it is connected to the performance of actions It is thus also connected to the will as well as the emotions On the other hand he places synderesis in the affective part of human beings for he regards synderesis as that which stimulates us to the good Conscience is divided into two general parts by Bonaventure The first part seems to be a power for discovering the truth of very general practical principles like obey God honor your parents and do not harm your neighbors This part of conscience is innate and unerring it cannot be lost to any person no matter how morally corrupt that person may become The second part of conscience involves the application of the very general principles to situations that may be either general or particular This second part is also innate but it can be mistaken since the very general principles of the first part may be misapplied through ignorance or faulty reasoning The misapplication explains to a certain extent how conscience oriented to good can be involved in the performance of evil actions The distinction between the two parts of conscience also opens up the possibility for developing through experience practical principles of behavior not directly entailed by the content of the synderesis By generalizing on activities performed in accordance with the principles of the synderesis one can formulate new general principles not contained in the synderesis that can guide behavior in a number of contexts Conscience thus appears to be a dynamic faculty for Bonaventure Bonaventure calls synderesis the spark of conscience and he sees it as resting in the affective part of human beings It is the spark because as the general drive to do good synderesis provides the movement that conscience needs to operate In general Bonaventure regards conscience and synderesis as interpenetrating one another The formation of ethical rules by conscience is seen by him as an implementation of a human being desire for good the synderesis He also sees the following of these principles as another aspect of the desire for good Because we naturally have a desire for the good we also desire the means to that goal The principles of conscience are such means and so we are naturally disposed to carry out the principles of conscience Similarly the emotional reaction to doing evil guilt or remorse is a reaction to the frustration of the desire for good caused when one fails to adhere to what the conscience has determined will lead to good Bonaventure while placing synderesis and conscience in different parts of a human being does not isolate them On the contrary he views conscience as driven by synderesis and at the same time directing synderesis Aquinas Thomas Aquinas the principal advocate of the intellectualistic view of the relationship of conscience and synderesis explicitly defines conscience as the application of knowledge to activity Summa Theologiae I II I The knowledge he has in mind here comes from the synderesis which he regards as the natural disposition of the human mind by which we apprehend without inquiry the basic principles of behavior For Aquinas then the conscience applies the first principles of the synderesis to particular situations The principles of synderesis are rather general in form Examples are Do good and avoid evil and Obey God To be helpful in human activity conscience requires principles that contain much more content One can call these secondary principles and Aquinas discusses them in several places and suggests that they are derived from experience and instruction through the virtue of prudence Thus the function of conscience for Aquinas is to apply the general principles of synderesis and the more content laden secondary principles developed from prudence to particular circumstances Prudence is involved in the application to particular circumstances according to Aquinas because it is connected to the correct perception of individual circumstances And this aspect of prudence connects both conscience and prudence to the problem of weakness of will In Aquinas presentation of Aristotle discussion of weakness of will in his Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics the fourth position offered in Book Chapter of the Nicomachean Ethics is emphasized According to this position the incontinent man knows the appropriate general principles of behavior concerning what should be done one should not fornicate If the incontinent man sees a particular action as falling under this general principle a man sees that having intercourse with an unmarried woman is a case of fornication he will not perform the action However the incontinent man also holds the general rule that pleasures should be enjoyed If the incontinent man driven by his particular desire for a particular unmarried woman sees the proposed sexual liaison as a case of pleasure he subsumes it under the general rule about pursuing pleasure and pursues the relationship The desire he has as it were blinds him to the general principle about fornication he still possesses but only habitually The actual knowledge he possesses is that the proposed liaison is a case of pleasure to be pursued He thus has habitually the knowledge that he should avoid fornication but he fornicates nonetheless because he actually sees the fornication as an act of pleasure to be pursued As a general comment on Aristotle analysis Aquinas remarks It is not the knowledge of the universal but only the evaluation of the sensible which is not so excellent that is dragged about by passion Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics Book lecture paragraph The point Aquinas is making is that the incontinent man possesses the knowledge of what he should do but he is driven by the passion he has for a particular this passion leads him to act contrary to what the knows habitually should not be done The incontinent man so fails because he has failed to cultivate the appropriate virtues that would enable him to size up the situation correctly synesis and deliberate well about it eubulia This analysis of weakness of will falls in line with Aquinas general view of the will as a passive potency that always follows the judgments of the intellect While this view of the will is modified by such disciples of Aquinas as Giles of Rome perhaps under the impetus of the Condemnations of Aquinas linking of conscience with prudence and the virtues in general through his concern with weakness of will is innovative and undoubtedly connected with his interest in the Nicomachean Ethics Duns Scotus and William of Ockham follow his lead in linking conscience with issues surrounding development of the virtues Scotus and Ockham Scotus offers very little explicit discussion of either conscience or synderesis Yet from his discussion of issues chiefly concerned with development of the virtues it is apparent that his view of conscience and synderesis seems to draw from both Bonaventure and Aquinas Following Aquinas Scotus thinks that both synderesis and conscience are to be placed in the intellectual order In agreement with Bonaventure Scotus gives conscience much more of a dynamic role in the human personality than a mechanical application of general principles Scotus close linking of conscience and the development of the virtues allows him to combine the two sources According to the virtue tradition in order to perform a virtuous action one must have the right dictates associated with the relevant virtue Yet one must perform appropriate virtuous actions to develop the habit of the virtue and to know the relevant right dictates The obvious circularity seems vicious enough to undermine any attempt to cultivate virtues Scotus regards conscience as offering a way into the circle Whenever a person formulates what is to be done in some circumstance this is an exercise of conscience which has determined proper action from the principles of synderesis On the basis of the dictates of conscience a person can perform an action that will provide the basis for the development of the relevant virtues For the performance of these acts from conscience leads to the type of habit that Scotus thinks of as a virtue Ideally the moral virtues are unified since a perfect virtuous person should possess all virtues In fact Scotus perfect virtuous person seems very similar to Aristotle man of practical wisdom This is the person who has through long experience developed the moral virtues and is able to deliberate so well about all moral situations that in Aristotle view to be moral is to do what a man of practical wisdom would do Scotus perfect virtuous person like the man of practical wisdom is skilled at determining what should be done in given circumstances he takes delight in acting in accord with his virtues and he possesses all of the moral virtues by developing them through experience Ockham discussion of conscience prudence and the virtues indicates that he follows Scotus turn towards discussing conscience in relation to the virtues He agrees with Scotus that conscience can provide the entry into the seeming circularity of performing virtuous actions in order to develop intentions that seem to be required for performing the virtuous actions in the first place Nevertheless he criticizes Scotus for failing to make a number of necessary distinctions about degrees of virtues and the relationship of conscience to prudence He never mentions synderesis in his writings and emphasizes the fact that only internal acts have moral worth According to him external acts are morally significant only by extrinsic denomination from internal acts Particularly in these last two claims Ockham exercised considerable influence on Reformation thinkers like Luther and Calvin in their discussions of conscience In fact the topics of conscience and synderesis were discussed in German universities with great attention both before and after the Reformation Some of the thinkers involved in these discussions Usingen and Peyligk adhered in various ways to the views of Bonaventure Aquinas Scotus and Ockham while others Bernhardi and Melanchthon blended and transformed the various views found among these thinkers Many of these discussions related conscience to issues about practical reasoning Interestingly discussions of conscience and synderesis appeared in works on natural philosophy After Luther the linking of conscience with practical knowledge found in the writings of Aquinas Scotus and Ockham gives way under the influence of Joseph Butler and Immanuel Kant to conceiving of conscience as a faculty Truth is one of the central subjects in philosophy It is also one of the largest Truth has been a topic of discussion in its own right for thousands of years Moreover a huge variety of issues in philosophy relate to truth either by relying on theses about truth or implying theses about truth It would be impossible to survey all there is to say about truth in any coherent way Instead this essay will concentrate on the main themes in the study of truth in the contemporary philosophical literature It will attempt to survey the key problems and theories of current interest and show how they relate to one another A number of other entries investigate many of these topics in greater depth Generally discussion of the principal arguments is left to them The goal of this essay is only to provide an overview of the current Theories Many of the papers mentioned in this essay can be found in the anthologies edited by Blackburn and Simmons and Lynch There are also a number of book length surveys of the topics discussed here including Burgess and Burgess Kirkham and K√ºnne The problem of truth is in a way easy to state what truths are and what if anything makes them true But this simple statement masks a great deal of controversy Whether there is a metaphysical problem of truth at all and if there is what kind of theory might address it are all standing issues in the theory of truth We will see a number of distinct ways of answering these questions Much of the contemporary literature on truth takes as its starting point some ideas which were prominent in the early part of the century There were a number of views of truth under discussion at that time the most significant for the contemporary literature being the correspondence coherence and pragmatist theories of truth These theories all attempt to directly answer the nature question what is the nature of truth They take this question at face value there are truths and the question to be answered concerns their nature In answering this question each theory makes the notion of truth part of a more thoroughgoing metaphysics or epistemology Explaining the nature of truth becomes an application of some metaphysical system and truth inherits significant metaphysical presuppositions along the way The goal of this section is to characterize the ideas of the correspondence coherence and pragmatist theories which animate the contemporary debate In some cases the received forms of these theories depart from the views that were actually defended in the early century We thus dub them the neo classical theories Where appropriate we pause to indicate how the neo classical theories emerge from their classical roots in the early century Perhaps the most important of the neo classical theories for the contemporary literature is the correspondence theory Ideas that sound strikingly like a correspondence theory are no doubt very old They might well be found in Aristotle or Aquinas When we turn to the late and early centuries where we pick up the story of the neo classical theories of truth it is clear that ideas about correspondence were central to the discussions of the time In spite of their importance however it is strikingly difficult to find an accurate citation in the early century for the received neo classical view Furthermore the way the correspondence theory actually emerged will provide some valuable reference points for the contemporary debate For these reasons we dwell on the origins of the correspondence theory in the late and early centuries at greater length than those of the other neo classical views before turning to its contemporary neo classical form The basic idea of the correspondence theory is that what we believe or say is true if it corresponds to the way things actually are to the facts This idea can be seen in various forms throughout the history of philosophy Its modern history starts with the beginnings of analytic philosophy at the turn of the century particularly in the work of Moore and Bertrand Russell Let us pick up the thread of this story in the years between and about These years are marked by Moore and Russell rejection of idealism Yet at this point they do not hold a correspondence theory of truth Indeed Moore sees the correspondence theory as a source of idealism and rejects it Russell follows Moore in this regard For discussion of Moore early critique of idealism where he rejects the correspondence theory of truth see Baldwin Hylton provides an extensive discussion of Russell in the context of British idealism In this period Moore and Russell hold a version of the identity theory of truth They say comparatively little about it but it is stated briefly in Moore and Russell According to the identity theory a true proposition is identical to a fact Specifically in Moore and Russell hands the theory begins with propositions understood as the objects of beliefs and other propositional attitudes Propositions are what are believed and give the contents of beliefs They are also according to this theory the primary bearers of truth When a proposition is true it is identical to a fact and a belief in that proposition is correct Related ideas about the identity theory and idealism are discussed by McDowell and further developed by Hornsby The identity theory Moore and Russell espoused takes truth to be a property of propositions Furthermore taking up an idea familiar to readers of Moore the property of truth is a simple unanalyzable property Facts are understood as simply those propositions which are true There are true propositions and false ones and facts just are true propositions There is thus no difference between truth and the reality to which it is supposed to correspond Moore For further discussion of the identity theory of truth see Baldwin Candlish Cartwright Dodd and the entry on the identity theory of truth Moore and Russell came to reject the identity theory of truth in favor of a correspondence theory sometime around as we see in Moore which reports lectures he gave in and Russell They do so because they came to reject the existence of propositions Why Among reasons they came to doubt that there could be any such things as false propositions and then concluded that there are no such things as propositions at all Why did Moore and Russell find false propositions problematic A full answer to this question is a point of scholarship that would take us too far afield Moore himself lamented that he could not put the objection in a clear and convincing way but see Cartwright and David for careful and clear exploration of the arguments But very roughly the identification of facts with true propositions left them unable to see what a false proposition could be other than something which is just like a fact though false If such things existed we would have fact like things in the world which Moore and Russell now see as enough to make false propositions count as true Hence they cannot exist and so there are no false propositions As Russell later says propositions seem to be at best curious shadowy things in addition to facts As Cartwright reminds us it is useful to think of this argument in the context of Russell slightly earlier views about propositions As we see clearly in Russell for instance he takes propositions to have constituents But they are not mere collections of constituents but a unity which brings the constituents together We thus confront the problem of the unity of the proposition But what we might ask would be the unity of a proposition that Samuel Ramey sings with constituents Ramey and singing except Ramey bearing the property of singing If that is what the unity consists in then we seem to have nothing other than the fact that Ramey sings But then we could not have genuine false propositions without having false facts As Cartwright also reminds us there is some reason to doubt the cogency of this sort of argument But let us put the assessment of the arguments aside and continue the story From the rejection of propositions a correspondence theory emerges The primary bearers of truth are no longer propositions but beliefs themselves In a slogan A belief is true if and only if it corresponds to a fact Views like this are held by Moore and Russell Of course to understand such a theory we need to understand the crucial relation of correspondence as well as the notion of a fact to which a belief corresponds We now turn to these questions In doing so we will leave the history and present a somewhat more modern reconstruction of a correspondence theory The correspondence theory of truth is at its core an ontological thesis a belief is true if there exists an appropriate entity a fact to which it corresponds If there is no such entity the belief is false Facts for the neo classical correspondence theory are entities in their own right Facts are generally taken to be composed of particulars and properties and relations or universals at least The neo classical correspondence theory thus only makes sense within the setting of a metaphysics that includes such facts Hence it is no accident that as Moore and Russell turn away from the identity theory of truth the metaphysics of facts takes on a much more significant role in their views This perhaps becomes most vivid in the later Russell where the existence of facts is the first truism The influence of Wittgenstein ideas to appear in the Tractatus on Russell in this period was strong and indeed the Tractatus remains one of the important sources for the neo classical correspondence theory For more recent extensive discussions of facts see Armstrong and Neale Consider for example the belief that Ramey sings Let us grant that this belief is true In what does its truth consist according to the correspondence theory It consists in there being a fact in the world built from the individual Ramey and the property of singing Let us denote this Ramey Singing This fact exists In contrast the world we presume contains no fact Ramey Dancing The belief that Ramey sings stands in the relation of correspondence to the fact Ramey Singing and so the belief is true What is the relation of correspondence One of the standing objections to the classical correspondence theory is that a fully adequate explanation of correspondence proves elusive But for a simple belief like that Ramey sings we can observe that the structure of the fact Ramey Singing matches the subject predicate form of the that clause which reports the belief and may well match the structure of the belief itself So far we have very much the kind of view that Moore and Russell would have found congenial But the modern form of the correspondence theory seeks to round out the explanation of correspondence by appeal to propositions Indeed it is common to base a correspondence theory of truth upon the notion of a structured proposition Propositions are again cast as the contents of beliefs and assertions and propositions have structure which at least roughly corresponds to the structure of sentences At least for simple beliefs like that Ramey sings the proposition has the same subject predicate structure as the sentence Proponents of structured propositions such as Kaplan often look to Russell for inspiration and find unconvincing Russell reasons for rejecting them With facts and structured propositions in hand an attempt may be made to explain the relation of correspondence Correspondence holds between a proposition and a fact when the proposition and fact have the same structure and the same constituents at each structural position When they correspond the proposition and fact thus mirror each other In our simple example we might have proposition that Ramey sings fact Ramey Singing Propositions though structured like facts can be true or false In a false case like the proposition that Ramey dances we would find no fact at the bottom of the corresponding diagram Beliefs are true or false depending on whether the propositions which are believed are We have sketched this view for simple propositions like the proposition that Ramey sings How to extend it to more complex cases like general propositions or negative propositions is an issue we will not delve into here It requires deciding whether there are complex facts such as general facts or negative facts or whether there is a more complex relation of correspondence between complex propositions and simple facts The issue of whether there are such complex facts marks a break between Russell and Wittgenstein and the earlier views which Moore and Russell sketch According to the correspondence theory as sketched here what is key to truth is a relation between propositions and the world which obtains when the world contains a fact that is structurally similar to the proposition Though this is not the theory Moore and Russell held it weaves together ideas of theirs with a more modern take on structured propositions We will thus dub it the neo classical correspondence theory This theory offers us a paradigm example of a correspondence theory of truth The leading idea of the correspondence theory is familiar It is a form of the older idea that true beliefs show the right kind of resemblance to what is believed In contrast to earlier empiricist theories the thesis is not that one ideas per se resemble what they are about Rather the propositions which give the contents of one true beliefs mirror reality in virtue of entering into correspondence relations to the right pieces of it In this theory it is the way the world provides us with appropriately structured entities that explains truth Our metaphysics thus explains the nature of truth by providing the entities needed to enter into correspondence relations For more on the correspondence theory see David and the entry on the correspondance theory of truth Though initially the correspondence theory was seen by its developers as a competitor to the identity theory of truth it was also understood as opposed to the coherence theory of truth We will be much briefer with the historical origins of the coherence theory than we were with the correspondence theory Like the correspondence theory versions of the coherence theory can be seen throughout the history of philosophy See for instance Walker for a discussion of its early modern lineage Like the correspondence theory it was important in the early century British origins of analytic philosophy Particularly the coherence theory of truth is associated with the British idealists to whom Moore and Russell were reacting Many idealists at that time did indeed hold coherence theories Let us take as an example Joachim This is the theory that Russell attacks Joachim says that Truth in its essential nature is that systematic coherence which is the character of a significant whole We will not attempt a full exposition of Joachim view which would take us well beyond the discussion of truth into the details of British idealism But a few remarks about his theory will help to give substance to the quoted passage Perhaps most importantly Joachim talks of truth in the singular This is not merely a turn of phrase but a reflection of his monistic idealism Joachim insists that what is true is the whole complete truth Individual judgments or beliefs are certainly not the whole complete truth Such judgments are according to Joachim only true to a degree One aspect of this doctrine is a kind of holism about content which holds that any individual belief or judgment gets its content only in virtue of being part of a system of judgments But even these systems are only true to a degree measuring the extent to which they express the content of the single whole complete truth Any real judgment we might make will only be partially true To flesh out Joachim theory we would have to explain what a significant whole is We will not attempt that as it leads us to some of the more formidable aspects of his view that it is a process of self fulfillment But it is clear that Joachim takes systematic coherence to be stronger than consistency In keeping with his holism about content he rejects the idea that coherence is a relation between independently identified contents and so finds it necessary to appeal to significant wholes As with the correspondence theory it will be useful to recast the coherence theory in a more modern form which will abstract away from some of the difficult features of British idealism As with the correspondence theory it can be put in a slogan A belief is true if and only if it is part of a coherent system of beliefs To further the contrast with the neo classical correspondence theory we may add that a proposition is true if it is the content of a belief in the system or entailed by a belief in the system We may assume with Joachim that the condition of coherence will be stronger than consistency With the idealists generally we might suppose that features of the believing subject will come into play This theory is offered as an analysis of the nature of truth and not simply a test or criterion for truth Put as such it is clearly not Joachim theory it lacks his monism and he rejects propositions but it is a standard take on coherence in the contemporary literature It is the way the coherence theory is given in Walker for instance See also Young for a recent defense of a coherence theory Let us take this as our neo classical version of the coherence theory The contrast with the correspondence theory of truth is clear Far from being a matter of whether the world provides a suitable object to mirror a proposition truth is a matter of how beliefs are related to each other The coherence theory of truth enjoys two sorts of motivations One is primarily epistemological Most coherence theorists also hold a coherence theory of knowledge more specifically a coherence theory of justification According to this theory to be justified is to be part of a coherent system of beliefs An argument for this is often based on the claim that only another belief could stand in a justification relation to a belief allowing nothing but properties of systems of belief including coherence to be conditions for justification Combining this with the thesis that a fully justified belief is true forms an argument for the coherence theory of truth An argument along these lines is found in Blanshard who holds a form of the coherence theory closely related to Joachim The steps in this argument may be questioned by a number of contemporary epistemological views But the coherence theory also goes hand in hand with its own metaphysics as well The coherence theory is typically associated with idealism As we have already discussed forms of it were held by British idealists such as Joachim and later by Blanshard in America An idealist should see the last step in the justification argument as quite natural More generally an idealist will see little if any room between a system of beliefs and the world it is about leaving the coherence theory of truth as an extremely natural option It is possible to be an idealist without adopting a coherence theory For instance many scholars read Bradley as holding a version of the identity theory of truth See Baldwin for some discussion However it is hard to see much of a way to hold the coherence theory of truth without maintaining some form of idealism If there is nothing to truth beyond what is to be found in an appropriate system of beliefs then it would seem one beliefs constitute the world in a way that amounts to idealism Walker argues that every coherence theorist must be an idealist but not vice versa The neo classical correspondence theory seeks to capture the intuition that truth is a content to world relation It captures this in the most straightforward way by asking for an object in the world to pair up with a true proposition The neo classical coherence theory in contrast insists that truth is not a content to world relation at all rather it is a content to content or belief to belief relation The coherence theory requires some metaphysics which can make the world somehow reflect this and idealism appears to be it A distant descendant of the neo classical coherence theory that does not require idealism will be discussed in section below For more on the coherence theory see the entry on the coherence theory of truth A different perspective on truth was offered by the American pragmatists As with the neo classical correspondence and coherence theories the pragmatist theories go with some typical slogans For example Peirce is usually understood as holding the view that Truth is the end of inquiry See for instance Hartshorne et al Both Peirce and James are associated with the slogan that Truth is satisfactory to believe James understands this principle as telling us what practical value truth has True beliefs are guaranteed not to conflict with subsequent experience Likewise Peirce slogan tells us that true beliefs will remain settled at the end of prolonged inquiry Peirce slogan is perhaps most typically associated with pragmatist views of truth so we might take it to be our canonical neo classical theory However the contemporary literature does not seem to have firmly settled upon a received neo classical pragmatist theory In her reconstruction upon which we have relied heavily Haack notes that the pragmatists views on truth also make room for the idea that truth involves a kind of correspondence insofar as the scientific method of inquiry is answerable to some independent world Peirce for instance does not reject a correspondence theory outright rather he complains that it provides merely a nominal or transcendental definition of truth Hartshorne et al which is cut off from practical matters of experience belief and doubt See Misak for an extended discussion This marks an important difference between the pragmatist theories and the coherence theory we just considered Even so pragmatist theories also have an affinity with coherence theories insofar as we expect the end of inquiry to be a coherent system of beliefs As Haack also notes James maintains an important verificationist idea truth is what is verifiable We will see this idea re appear in section James views are discussed further in the entry on William James Peirce views are discussed further in the entry on Charles Sanders Peirce Tarski theory of truth Modern forms of the classical theories survive Many of these modern theories notably correspondence theories draw on ideas developed by Tarski In this regard it is important to bear in mind that his seminal work on truth is very much of a piece with other works in mathematical logic such as his and as much as anything this work lays the ground work for the modern subject of model theory a branch of mathematical logic not the metaphysics of truth In this respect Tarski work provides a set of highly useful tools that may be employed in a wide range of philosophical projects See Patterson for more on Tarski work in its historical context Tarski work has a number of components which we will consider in turn In the classical debate on truth at the beginning of the century we considered in section the issue of truth bearers was of great significance For instance Moore and Russell turn to the correspondence theory was driven by their views on whether there are propositions to be the bearers of truth Many theories we reviewed took beliefs to be the bearers of truth In contrast Tarski and much of the subsequent work on truth takes sentences to be the primary bearers of truth This is not an entirely novel development Russell also takes truth to apply to sentence which he calls propositions in that text But whereas much of the classical debate takes the issue of the primary bearers of truth to be a substantial and important metaphysical one Tarski is quite casual about it His primary reason for taking sentences as truth bearers is convenience and he explicitly distances himself from any commitment about the philosophically contentious issues surrounding other candidate truth bearers Tarski Russell makes a similar suggestion that sentences are the appropriate truth bearers for the purposes of logic though he still takes the classical metaphysical issues to be important We will return to the issue of the primary bearers of truth in section For the moment it will be useful to simply follow Tarski lead But it should be stressed that for this discussion sentences are fully interpreted sentences having meanings We will also assume that the sentences in question do not change their content across occasions of use that they display no context dependence We are taking sentences to be what Quine calls eternal sentences In some places Tarski Tarski refers to his view as the semantic conception of truth It is not entirely clear just what Tarski had in mind by this but it is clear enough that Tarski theory defines truth for sentences in terms of concepts like reference and satisfaction which are intimately related to the basic semantic functions of names and predicates according to many approaches to semantics Let us suppose we have a fixed language whose sentences are fully interpreted The basic question Tarski poses is what an adequate theory of truth for would be Tarski answer is embodied in what he calls Convention An adequate theory of truth for must imply for each sentence of is true if and only if We have simplified Tarski presentation somewhat This is an adequacy condition for theories not a theory itself Given the assumption that is fully interpreted we may assume that each sentence in fact has a truth value In light of this Convention guarantees that the truth predicate given by the theory will be extensionally correct have as its extension all and only the true sentences of Convention draws our attention to the biconditionals of the form is true if and only if which are usually called the Tarski biconditionals for a language Tarski does not merely propose a condition of adequacy for theories of truth he also shows how to meet it One of his insights is that if the language displays the right structure then truth for can be defined recursively For instance let us suppose that is a simple formal language containing two atomic sentences snow is white and grass is green and the sentential connectives and In spite of its simplicity contains infinitely many distinct sentences But truth can be defined for all of them by recursion Base clauses Snow is white is true if and only if snow is white Grass is green is true if and only if grass is green Recursion clauses For any sentences and of is true if and only if is true or is true is true if and only if it is not the case that is true This theory satisfies Convention This may look trivial but in defining an extensionally correct truth predicate for an infinite language with four clauses we have made a modest application of a very powerful technique Tarski techniques go further however They do not stop with atomic sentences Tarski notes that truth for each atomic sentence can be defined in terms of two closely related notions reference and satisfaction Let us consider a language just like except that instead of simply having two atomic sentences breaks atomic sentences into terms and predicates contains terms snow and grass let us engage in the idealization that these are simply singular terms and predicates is white and is green So is like but also contains the sentences Snow is green and Grass is white We can define truth for atomic sentences of in the following way Base clauses Snow refers to snow Grass refers to grass a satisfies is white if and only if a is white a satisfies is green if and only if a is green For any atomic sentence is is is true if and only if the referent of satisfies One of Tarski key insights is that the apparatus of satisfaction allows for a recursive definition of truth for sentences with quantifiers though we will not examine that here We could repeat the recursion clauses for to produce a full theory of truth for Let us say that a Tarskian theory of truth is a recursive theory built up in ways similar to the theory of truth for Tarski goes on to demonstrate some key applications of such a theory of truth A Tarskian theory of truth for a language can be used to show that theories in are consistent This was especially important to Tarski who was concerned the Liar paradox would make theories in languages containing a truth predicate inconsistent For more see the entries on axiomatic theories of truth the Liar paradox and Tarski truth definitions The correspondence theory of truth expresses the very natural idea that truth is a content to world or word to world relation what we say or think is true or false in virtue of the way the world turns out to be We suggested that against a background like the metaphysics of facts it does so in a straightforward way But the idea of correspondence is certainly not specific to this framework Indeed it is controversial whether a correspondence theory should rely on any particular metaphysics at all The basic idea of correspondence as Tarski and others have suggested is captured in the slogan from Aristotle Metaphysics to say of what is that it is or of what is not that it is not is true Ross What is it is natural enough to say is a fact but this natural turn of phrase may well not require a full blown metaphysics of facts Yet without the metaphysics of facts the notion of correspondence as discussed in section loses substance This has led to two distinct strands in contemporary thinking about the correspondence theory One strand seeks to recast the correspondence theory in a way that does not rely on any particular ontology Another seeks to find an appropriate ontology for correspondence either in terms of facts or other entities We will consider each in turn Tarski himself sometimes suggested that his theory was a kind of correspondence theory of truth Whether his own theory is a correspondence theory and even whether it provides any substantial philosophical account of truth at all is a matter of controversy One rather drastic negative assessment from Putnam is that As a philosophical account of truth Tarski theory fails as badly as it is possible for an account to fail But a number of philosophers Davidson Field have seen Tarski theory as providing at least the core of a correspondence theory of truth which dispenses with the metaphysics of facts Tarski theory shows how truth for a sentence is determined by certain properties of its constituents in particular by properties of reference and satisfaction as well as by the logical constants As it is normally understood reference is the preeminent word to world relation Satisfaction is naturally understood as a word to world relation as well which relates a predicate to the things in the world that bear it The Tarskian recursive definition shows how truth is determined by reference and satisfaction and so is in effect determined by the things in the world we refer to and the properties they bear This one might propose is all the correspondence we need It is not correspondence of sentences or propositions to facts rather it is correspondence of our expressions to objects and the properties they bear and then ways of working out the truth of claims in terms of this This is certainly not the neo classical idea of correspondence In not positing facts it does not posit any single object to which a true proposition or sentence might correspond Rather it shows how truth might be worked out from basic word to world relations However a number of authors have noted that Tarski theory cannot by itself provide us with such an account of truth As we will discuss more fully in section Tarski apparatus is in fact compatible with theories of truth that are certainly not correspondence theories Field in an influential discussion and diagnosis of what is lacking in Tarski account in effect points out that whether we really have something worthy of the name correspondence depends on our having notions of reference and satisfaction which genuinely establish word to world relations Field does not use the term correspondence but does talk about the connection between words and things By itself Field notes Tarski theory does not offer an account of reference and satisfaction at all Rather it offers a number of disquotation clauses such as Snow refers to snow a satisfies is white if and only if a is white These clauses have an air of triviality though whether they are to be understood as trivial principles or statements of non trivial semantic facts has been a matter of some debate With Field we might propose to supplement clauses like these with an account of reference and satisfaction Such a theory should tell us what makes it the case that the word snow refer to snow In Field was envisaging a physicalist account along the lines of the causal theory of reference This should inter alia guarantee that truth is really determined by word to world relations so in conjunction with the Tarskian recursive definition it could provide a correspondence theory of truth Such a theory clearly does not rely on a metaphysics of facts Indeed it is in many ways metaphysically neutral as it does not take a stand on the nature of particulars or of the properties or universals that underwrite facts about satisfaction However it may not be entirely devoid of metaphysical implications as we will discuss further in section Much of the subsequent discussion of Field style approaches to correspondence has focused on the role of representation in these views Field own discussion relies on a causal relation between terms and their referents and a similar relation for satisfaction These are instances of representation relations According to representational views meaningful items like perhaps thoughts or sentences or their constituents have their contents in virtue of standing in the right relation to the things they represent On many views including Field a name stands in such a relation to its bearer and the relation is a causal one The project of developing a naturalist account of the representation relation has been an important one in the philosophy of mind and language See the entry on mental representation But it has implications for the theory of truth Representational views of content lead naturally to correspondence theories of truth To make this vivid suppose you hold that sentences or beliefs stand in a representation relation to some objects It is natural to suppose that for true beliefs or sentences those objects would be facts We then have a correspondence theory with the correspondence relation explicated as a representation relation a truth bearer is true if it represents a fact As we have discussed many contemporary views reject facts but one can hold a representational view of content without them One interpretation of Field theory is just that The relations of reference and satisfaction are representation relations and truth for sentences is determined compositionally in terms of those representation relations and the nature of the objects they represent If we have such relations we have the building blocks for a correspondence theory without facts Field anticipated a naturalist reduction of the representation via a causal theory but any view that accepts representation relations for truth bearers or their constituents can provide a similar theory of truth See Jackson and Lynch for further discussion Representational views of content provide a natural way to approach the correspondence theory of truth and likewise anti representational views provide a natural way to avoid the correspondence theory of truth This is most clear in the work of Davidson as we will discuss more in section There have been a number of correspondence theories that do make use of facts Some are notably different from the neo classical theory sketched in section For instance Austin proposes a view in which each statement understood roughly as an utterance event corresponds to both a fact or situation and a type of situation It is true if the former is of the latter type This theory which has been developed by situation theory Barwise and Perry rejects the idea that correspondence is a kind of mirroring between a fact and a proposition Rather correspondence relations to Austin are entirely conventional See Vision for an extended defense of an Austinian correspondence theory As an ordinary language philosopher Austin grounds his notion of fact more in linguistic usage than in an articulated metaphysics but he defends his use of fact talk in Austin In a somewhat more Tarskian spirit formal theories of facts or states of affairs have also been developed For instance Taylor provides a recursive definition of a collection of states of affairs for a given language Taylor states of affairs seem to reflect the notion of fact at work in the neo classical theory though as an exercise in logic they are officially tuples of objects and intensions There are more metaphysically robust notions of fact in the current literature For instance Armstrong defends a metaphysics in which facts under the name states of affairs are metaphysically fundamental The view has much in common with the neo classical one Like the neo classical view Armstrong endorses a version of the correspondence theory States of affairs are truthmakers for propositions though Armstrong argues that there may be many such truthmakers for a given proposition and vice versa Armstrong also envisages a naturalistic account of propositions as classes of equivalent belief tokens Armstrong primary argument is what he calls the truthmaker argument It begins by advancing a truthmaker principle which holds that for any given truth there must be a truthmaker a something in the world which makes it the case that serves as an ontological ground for this truth It is then argued that facts are the appropriate truthmakers In contrast to the approach to correspondence discussed in section which offered correspondence with minimal ontological implications this view returns to the ontological basis of correspondence that was characteristic of the neo classical theory For more on facts see the entry on facts The truthmaker principle is often put as the schema If then there is an such that necessarily if exists then Fox proposed putting the principle this way rather than explicitly in terms of truth The truthmaker principle expresses the ontological aspect of the neo classical correspondence theory Not merely must truth obtain in virtue of word to world relations but there must be a thing that makes each truth true The neo classical correspondence theory and Armstrong cast facts as the appropriate truthmakers However it is a non trivial step from the truthmaker principle to the existence of facts There are a number of proposals in the literature for how other sorts of objects could be truthmakers for instance tropes called moments in Mulligan et al Parsons argues that the truthmaker principle presented in a somewhat different form is compatible with there being only concrete particulars As we saw in discussing the neo classical correspondence theory truthmaker theories and fact theories in particular raise a number of issues One which has been discussed at length for instance is whether there are negative facts Negative facts would be the truthmakers for negated sentences Russell notoriously expresses ambivalence about whether there are negative facts Armstrong rejects them while Beall defends them For more discussion of truthmakers see the papers in Beebee and Dodd The neo classical theories we surveyed in section made the theory of truth an application of their background metaphysics and in some cases epistemology In section and especially in section we returned to the issue of what sorts of ontological commitments might go with the theory of truth There we saw a range of options from relatively ontologically non committal theories to theories requiring highly specific ontologies There is another way in which truth relates to metaphysics Many ideas about realism and anti realism are closely related to ideas about truth Indeed many approaches to questions about realism and anti realism simply make them questions about truth In discussing the approach to correspondence of section we noted that it has few ontological requirements It relies on there being objects of reference and something about the world which makes for determinate satisfaction relations but beyond that it is ontologically neutral But as we mentioned there this is not to say that it has no metaphysical implications A correspondence theory of truth of any kind is often taken to embody a form of realism The key features of realism as we will take it are that The world exists objectively independently of the ways we think about it or describe it Our thoughts and claims are about that world Wright offers a nice statement of this way of thinking about realism These theses imply that our claims are objectively true or false depending on how the world they are about is The world that we represent in our thoughts or language is an objective world Realism may be restricted to some subject matter or range of discourse but for simplicity we will talk about only its global form It is often argued that these theses require some form of the correspondence theory of truth Putnam notes Whatever else realists say they typically say that they believe in a correspondence theory of truth At least they are supported by the kind of correspondence theory without facts discussed in section such as Field proposal Such a theory will provide an account of objective relations of reference and satisfaction and show how these determine the truth or falsehood of what we say about the world Field own approach to this problem seeks a physicalist explanation of reference But realism is a more general idea than physicalism Any theory that provides objective relations of reference and satisfaction and builds up a theory of truth from them would give a form of realism Making the objectivity of reference the key to realism is characteristic of work of Putnam Another important mark of realism expressed in terms of truth is the property of bivalence As Dummett has stressed a realist should see there being a fact of the matter one way or the other about whether any given claim is correct Hence one important mark of realism is that it goes together with the principle of bivalence every truth bearer sentence or proposition is true or false In much of his work Dummett has made this the characteristic mark of realism and often identifies realism about some subject matter with accepting bivalence for discourse about that subject matter At the very least it captures a great deal of what is more loosely put in the statement of realism above Either the approach makes the theory of truth or truth and reference the primary vehicle for an account of realism A theory of truth which substantiates bivalence or a determinate reference relation does most of the work of giving a realistic metaphysics It might even simply be a realistic metaphysics We have thus turned on its head the relation of truth to metaphysics we saw in our discussion of the neo classical correspondence theory in section There a correspondence theory of truth was built upon a substantial metaphysics Here we have seen how articulating a theory that captures the idea of correspondence can be crucial to providing a realist metaphysics For another perspective on realism and truth see Alston Devitt offers an opposing view to the kind we have sketched here which rejects any characterization of realism in terms of truth or other semantic concepts In light of our discussion in section we should pause to note that the connection between realism and the correspondence theory of truth is not absolute When Moore and Russell held the identity theory of truth they were most certainly realists The right kind of metaphysics of propositions can support a realist view as can a metaphysics of facts The modern form of realism we have been discussing here seeks to avoid basing itself on such particular ontological commitments and so prefers to rely on the kind of correspondence without facts approach discussed in section This is not to say that realism will be devoid of ontological commitments but the commitments will flow from whichever specific claims about some subject matter are taken to be true For more on realism and truth see Fumerton and the entry on realism It should come as no surprise that the relation between truth and metaphysics seen by modern realists can also be exploited by anti realists Many modern anti realists see the theory of truth as the key to formulating and defending their views With Dummett we might expect the characteristic mark of anti realism to be the rejection of bivalence Indeed many contemporary forms of anti realism may be formulated as theories of truth and they do typically deny bivalence Anti realism comes in many forms but let us take as an example a somewhat crude form of verificationism Such a theory holds that a claim is correct just insofar as it is in principle verifiable there is a verification procedure we could in principle carry out which would yield the answer that the claim in question was verified So understood verificationism is a theory of truth The claim is not that verification is the most important epistemic notion but that truth just is verifiability As with the kind of realism we considered in section this view expresses its metaphysical commitments in its explanation of the nature of truth Truth is not to this view a fully objective matter independent of us or our thoughts Instead truth is constrained by our abilities to verify and is thus constrained by our epistemic situation Truth is to a significant degree an epistemic matter which is typical of many anti realist positions As Dummett says the verificationist notion of truth does not appear to support bivalence Any statement that reaches beyond what we can in principle verify or refute verify its negation will be a counter example to bivalence Take for instance the claim that there is some substance say uranium present in some region of the universe too distant to be inspected by us within the expected lifespan of the universe Insofar as this really would be in principle unverifiable we have no reason to maintain it is true or false according to the verificationist theory of truth Verificationism of this sort is one of a family of anti realist views Another example is the view that identifies truth with warranted assertibility Assertibility as well as verifiability has been important in Dummett work See also works of McDowell and Wright Anti realism of the Dummettian sort is not a descendant of the coherence theory of truth per se But in some ways as Dummett himself has noted it might be construed as a descendant perhaps very distant of idealism If idealism is the most drastic form of rejection of the independence of mind and world Dummettian anti realism is a more modest form which sees epistemology imprinted in the world rather than the wholesale embedding of world into mind At the same time the idea of truth as warranted assertibility or verifiability reiterates a theme from the pragmatist views of truth we surveyed in section Anti realist theories of truth like the realist ones we discussed in section can generally make use of the Tarskian apparatus Convention in particular does not discriminate between realist and anti realist notions of truth Likewise the base clauses of a Tarskian recursive theory are given as disquotation principles which are neutral between realist and anti realist understandings of notions like reference As we saw with the correspondence theory giving a full account of the nature of truth will generally require more than the Tarskian apparatus itself How an anti realist is to explain the basic concepts that go into a Tarskian theory is a delicate matter As Dummett and Wright have investigated in great detail it appears that the background logic in which the theory is developed will have to be non classical For more on anti realism and truth see the papers in Greenough and Lynch and the entry on realism Many commentators see a close connection between Dummett anti realism and the pragmatists views of truth in that both put great weight on ideas of verifiability or assertibility Dummett himself stressed parallels between anti realism and intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics Another view on truth which returns to pragmatist themes is the internal realism of Putnam There Putnam glosses truth as what would be justified under ideal epistemic conditions With the pragmatists Putnam sees the ideal conditions as something which can be approximated echoing the idea of truth as the end of inquiry Putnam is cautious about calling his view anti realism preferring the label internal realism But he is clear that he sees his view as opposed to realism metaphysical realism as he calls it Davidson views on truth have also been associated with pragmatism notably by Rorty Davidson has distanced himself from this interpretation but he does highlight connections between truth and belief and meaning Insofar as these are human attitudes or relate to human actions Davidson grants there is some affinity between his views and those of some pragmatists especially he says Dewey Another view that has grown out of the literature on realism and anti realism and has become increasingly important in the current literature is that of pluralism about truth This view developed in work of Lynch and Wright proposes that there are multiple ways for truth bearers to be true Wright in particular suggests that in certain domains of discourse what we say is true in virtue of a correspondence like relation while in others it is its true in virtue of a kind of assertibility relation that is closer in spirit to the anti realist views we have just discussed Such a proposal might suggest there are multiple concepts of truth or that the term true is itself ambiguous However whether or not a pluralist view is committed to such claims has been disputed In particular Lynch develops a version of pluralism which takes truth to be a functional role concept The functional role of truth is characterized by a range of principles that articulate such features of truth as its objectivity its role in inquiry and related ideas we have encountered in considering various theories of truth A related point about platitudes governing the concept of truth is made by Wright But according to Lynch these display the functional role of truth Furthermore Lynch claims that on analogy with analytic functionalism these principles can be seen as deriving from our pre theoretic or folk ideas about truth Like all functional role concepts truth must be realized and according to Lynch it may be realized in different ways in different settings Such multiple realizability has been one of the hallmarks of functional role concepts discussed in the philosophy of mind For instance Lynch suggests that for ordinary claims about material objects truth might be realized by a correspondence property which he links to representational views while for moral claims truth might be manifest by an assertibility property along more anti realist lines For more on pluralism about truth see the entry on pluralist theories of truth Deflationism We began in section with the neo classical theories which explained the nature of truth within wider metaphysical systems We then considered some alternatives in sections and some of which had more modest ontological implications But we still saw in section that substantial theories of truth tend to imply metaphysical theses or even embody metaphysical positions One long standing trend in the discussion of truth is to insist that truth really does not carry metaphysical significance at all It does not as it has no significance on its own A number of different ideas have been advanced along these lines under the general heading of deflationism Deflationist ideas appear quite early on including a well known argument against correspondence in Frege However many deflationists take their cue from an idea of Ramsey often called the equivalence thesis is true has the same meaning as Ramsey himself takes truth bearers to be propositions rather than sentences Glanzberg questions whether Ramsey account of propositions really makes him a deflationist This can be taken as the core of a theory of truth often called the redundancy theory The redundancy theory holds that there is no property of truth at all and appearances of the expression true in our sentences are redundant having no effect on what we express The equivalence thesis can also be understood in terms of speech acts rather than meaning To assert that is true is just to assert that This view was advanced by Strawson though Strawson also argues that there are other important aspects of speech acts involving true beyond what is asserted For instance they may be acts of confirming or granting what someone else said Strawson would also object to my making sentences the bearers of truth In either its speech act or meaning form the redundancy theory argues there is no property of truth It is commonly noted that the equivalence thesis itself is not enough to sustain the redundancy theory It merely holds that when truth occurs in the outermost position in a sentence and the full sentence to which truth is predicated is quoted then truth is eliminable What happens in other environments is left to be seen Modern developments of the redundancy theory include Grover et al The equivalence principle looks familiar it has something like the form of the Tarski biconditionals discussed in section However it is a stronger principle which identifies the two sides of the biconditional either their meanings or the speech acts performed with them The Tarski biconditionals themselves are simply material biconditionals A number of deflationary theories look to the Tarski biconditionals rather than the full equivalence principle Their key idea is that even if we do not insist on redundancy we may still hold the following theses For a given language and every in the biconditionals is true if and only if hold by definition or analytically or trivially or by stipulation This is all there is to say about the concept of truth We will refer to views which adopt these as minimalist Officially this is the name of the view of Horwich but we will apply it somewhat more widely Horwich view differs in some specific respects from what is presented here such as predicating truth of propositions but we believe it is close enough to what is sketched here to justify the name The second thesis that the Tarski biconditionals are all there is to say about truth captures something similar to the redundancy theory view It comes near to saying that truth is not a property at all to the extent that truth is a property there is no more to it than the disquotational pattern of the Tarski biconditionals As Horwich puts it there is no substantial underlying metaphysics to truth And as Soames stresses certainly nothing that could ground as far reaching a view as realism or anti realism If there is no property of truth or no substantial property of truth what role does our term true play Deflationists typically note that the truth predicate provides us with a convenient device of disquotation Such a device allows us to make some useful claims which we could not formulate otherwise such as the blind ascription The next thing that Bill says will be true For more on blind ascriptions and their relation to deflationism see Azzouni A predicate obeying the Tarski biconditionals can also be used to express what would otherwise be potentially infinite conjunctions or disjunctions such as the notorious statement of Papal infallibility put Everything the Pope says is true Suggestions like this are found in Leeds and Quine Recognizing these uses for a truth predicate we might simply think of it as introduced into a language by stipulation The Tarski biconditionals themselves might be stipulated as the minimalists envisage One could also construe the clauses of a recursive Tarskian theory as stipulated There are some significant logical differences between these two options See Halbach and Ketland for discussion Other deflationists such as Beall or Field might prefer to focus here on rules of inference or rules of use rather than the Tarski biconditionals themselves There are also important connections between deflationist ideas about truth and certain ideas about meaning These are fundamental to the deflationism of Field which will be discussed in section For an insightful critique of deflationism see Gupta For more on deflationism see the entry on the deflationary theory of truth Truth and language One of the important themes in the literature on truth is its connection to meaning or more generally to language This has proved an important application of ideas about truth and an important issue in the study of truth itself This section will consider a number of issues relating truth and language There have been many debates in the literature over what the primary bearers of truth are Candidates typically include beliefs propositions sentences and utterances We have already seen in section that the classical debates on truth took this issue very seriously and what sort of theory of truth was viable was often seen to depend on what the bearers of truth are In spite of the number of options under discussion and the significance that has sometimes been placed on the choice there is an important similarity between candidate truth bearers Consider the role of truth bearers in the correspondence theory for instance We have seen versions of it which take beliefs propositions or interpreted sentences to be the primary bearers of truth But all of them rely upon the idea that their truth bearers are meaningful and are thereby able to say something about what the world is like We might say that they are able to represent the world but that is to use represent in a wider sense than we saw in section No assumptions about just what stands in relations to what objects are required to see truth bearers as meaningful It is in virtue of being meaningful that truth bearers are able to enter into correspondence relations Truth bearers are things which meaningfully make claims about what the world is like and are true or false depending on whether the facts in the world are as described Exactly the same point can be made for the anti realist theories of truth we saw in section though with different accounts of how truth bearers are meaningful and what the world contributes Though it is somewhat more delicate something similar can be said for coherence theories which usually take beliefs or whole systems of beliefs as the primary truth bearers Though a coherence theory will hardly talk of beliefs representing the facts it is crucial to the coherence theory that beliefs are contentful beliefs of agents and that they can enter into coherence relations Noting the complications in interpreting the genuine classical coherence theories it appears fair to note that this requires truth bearers to be meaningful however the background metaphysics presumably idealism understands meaning Though Tarski works with sentences the same can be said of his theory The sentences to which Tarski theory applies are fully interpreted and so also are meaningful They characterize the world as being some way or another and this in turn determines whether they are true or false Indeed Tarski needs there to be a fact of the matter about whether each sentence is true or false abstracting away from context dependence to ensure that the Tarski biconditionals do their job of fixing the extension of is true But note that just what this fact of the matter consists in is left open by the Tarskian apparatus We thus find the usual candidate truth bearers linked in a tight circle interpreted sentences the propositions they express the belief speakers might hold towards them and the acts of assertion they might perform with them are all connected by providing something meaningful This makes them reasonable bearers of truth For this reason it seems contemporary debates on truth have been much less concerned with the issue of truth bearers than were the classical ones Some issues remain of course Different metaphysical assumptions may place primary weight on some particular node in the circle and some metaphysical views still challenge the existence of some of the nodes Perhaps more importantly different views on the nature of meaning itself might cast doubt on the coherence of some of the nodes Notoriously for instance Quineans Quine deny the existence of intensional entities including propositions Even so it increasingly appears doubtful that attention to truth per se will bias us towards one particular primary bearer of truth There is a related but somewhat different point which is important to understanding the theories we have canvassed The neo classical theories of truth start with truth bearers which are already understood to be meaningful and explain how they get their truth values But along the way they often do something more Take the neo classical correspondence theory for instance This theory in effect starts with a view of how propositions are meaningful They are so in virtue of having constituents in the world which are brought together in the right way There are many complications about the nature of meaning but at a minimum this tells us what the truth conditions associated with a proposition are The theory then explains how such truth conditions can lead to the truth value true by the right fact existing Many theories of truth are like the neo classical correspondence theory in being as much theories of how truth bearers are meaningful as of how their truth values are fixed Again abstracting from some complications about meaning this makes them theories both of truth conditions and truth values The Tarskian theory of truth can be construed this way too This can be seen both in the way the Tarski biconditionals are understood and how a recursive theory of truth is understood As we explained Convention in section the primary role of a Tarski biconditional of the form is true if and only if is to fix whether is in the extension of is true or not But it can also be seen as stating the truth conditions of Both rely on the fact that the unquoted occurrence of is an occurrence of an interpreted sentence which has a truth value but also provides its truth conditions upon occasions of use Likewise the base clauses of the recursive definition of truth those for reference and satisfaction are taken to state the relevant semantic properties of constituents of an interpreted sentence In discussing Tarski theory of truth in section we focused on how these determine the truth value of a sentence But they also show us the truth conditions of a sentence are determined by these semantic properties For instance for a simple sentence like Snow is white the theory tells us that the sentence is true if the referent of Snow satisfies white This can be understood as telling us that the truth conditions of Snow is white are those conditions in which the referent of Snow satisfies the predicate is white As we saw in sections and the Tarskian apparatus is often seen as needing some kind of supplementation to provide a full theory of truth A full theory of truth conditions will likewise rest on how the Tarskian apparatus is put to use In particular just what kinds of conditions those in which the referent of snow satisfies the predicate is white are will depend on whether we opt for realist or anti realist theories The realist option will simply look for the conditions under which the stuff snow bears the property of whiteness the anti realist option will look to the conditions under which it can be verified or asserted with warrant that snow is white There is a broad family of theories of truth which are theories of truth conditions as well as truth values This family includes the correspondence theory in all its forms classical and modern Yet this family is much wider than the correspondence theory and wider than realist theories of truth more generally Indeed virtually all the theories of truth that make contributions to the realism anti realism debate are theories of truth conditions In a slogan for many approaches to truth a theory of truth is a theory of truth conditions Any theory that provides a substantial account of truth conditions can offer a simple account of truth values a truth bearer provides truth conditions and it is true if and only if the actual way things are is among them Because of this any such theory will imply a strong but very particular biconditional close in form to the Tarski biconditionals It can be made most vivid if we think of propositions as sets of truth conditions Let be a proposition a set of truth conditions and let a be the actual world the condition that actually obtains Then we can almost trivially see is true if and only if a This is presumably necessary But it is important to observe that it is in one respect crucially different from the genuine Tarski biconditionals It makes no use of a non quoted sentence or in fact any sentence at all It does not have the disquotational character of the Tarski biconditionals Though this may look like a principle that deflationists should applaud it is not Rather it shows that deflationists cannot really hold a truth conditional view of content at all If they do then they inter alia have a non deflationary theory of truth simply by linking truth value to truth conditions through the above biconditional It is typical of thoroughgoing deflationist theories to present a non truth conditional theory of the contents of sentences a non truth conditional account of what makes truth bearers meaningful We take it this is what is offered for instance by the use theory of propositions in Horwich It is certainly one of the leading ideas of Field which explore how a conceptual role account of content would ground a deflationist view of truth Once one has a non truth conditional account of content it is then possible to add a deflationist truth predicate and use this to give purely deflationist statements of truth conditions But the starting point must be a non truth conditional view of what makes truth bearers meaningful Both deflationists and anti realists start with something other than correspondence truth conditions But whereas an anti realist will propose a different theory of truth conditions a deflationists will start with an account of content which is not a theory of truth conditions at all The deflationist will then propose that the truth predicate given by the Tarski biconditionals is an additional device not for understanding content but for disquotation It is a useful device as we discussed in section but it has nothing to do with content To a deflationist the meaningfulness of truth bearers has nothing to do with truth It has been an influential idea since the seminal work of Davidson to see a Tarskian theory of truth as a theory of meaning At least as we have seen a Tarskian theory can be seen as showing how the truth conditions of a sentence are determined by the semantic properties of its parts More generally as we see in much of the work of Davidson and of Dummett giving a theory of truth conditions can be understood as a crucial part of giving a theory of meaning Thus any theory of truth that falls into the broad category of those which are theories of truth conditions can be seen as part of a theory of meaning For more discussion of these issues see Higginbotham and the exchange between Higginbotham and Soames A number of commentators on Tarski Etchemendy Soames have observed that the Tarskian apparatus needs to be understood in a particular way to make it suitable for giving a theory of meaning Tarski work is often taken to show how to define a truth predicate If it is so used then whether or not a sentence is true becomes in essence a truth of mathematics Presumably what truth conditions sentences of a natural language have is a contingent matter so a truth predicate defined in this way cannot be used to give a theory of meaning for them But the Tarskian apparatus need not be used just to explicitly define truth The recursive characterization of truth can be used to state the semantic properties of sentences and their constituents as a theory of meaning should In such an application truth is not taken to be explicitly defined but rather the truth conditions of sentences are taken to be described See Heck for more discussion Inspired by Quine Davidson himself is well known for taking a different approach to using a theory of truth as a theory of meaning than is implicit in Field Whereas a Field inspired representational approach is based on a causal account of reference Davidson proposes a process of radical interpretation in which an interpreter builds a Tarskian theory to interpret a speaker as holding beliefs which are consistent coherent and largely true This led Davidson to argue that most of our beliefs are true a conclusion that squares well with the coherence theory of truth This is a weaker claim than the neo classical coherence theory would make It does not insist that all the members of any coherent set of beliefs are true or that truth simply consists in being a member of such a coherent set But all the same the conclusion that most of our beliefs are true because their contents are to be understood through a process of radical interpretation which will make them a coherent and rational system has a clear affinity with the neo classical coherence theory In Davidson he thought his view of truth had enough affinity with the neo classical coherence theory to warrant being called a coherence theory of truth while at the same time he saw the role of Tarskian apparatus as warranting the claim that his view was also compatible with a kind of correspondence theory of truth In later work however Davidson reconsidered this position In fact already in Davidson he had expressed doubt about any understanding of the role of Tarski theory in radical interpretation that involves the kind of representational apparatus relied on by Field as we discussed in sections and In the Afterthoughts to Davidson he also concluded that his view departs too far from the neo classical coherence theory to be named one What is important is rather the role of radical interpretation in the theory of content and its leading to the idea that belief is veridical These are indeed points connected to coherence but not to the coherence theory of truth per se They also comprise a strong form of anti representationalism Thus though he does not advance a coherence theory of truth he does advance a theory that stands in opposition to the representational variants of the correspondence theory we discussed in section For more on Davidson see Glanzberg and the entry on Donald Davidson The relation between truth and meaning is not the only place where truth and language relate closely Another is the idea also much stressed in the writings of Dummett of the relation between truth and assertion Again it fits into a platitude Truth is the aim of assertion A person making an assertion the platitude holds aims to say something true It is easy to cast this platitude in a way that appears false Surely many speakers do not aim to say something true Any speaker who lies does not Any speaker whose aim is to flatter or to deceive aims at something other than truth The motivation for the truth assertion platitude is rather different It looks at assertion as a practice in which certain rules are constitutive As is often noted the natural parallel here is with games like chess or baseball which are defined by certain rules The platitude holds that it is constitutive of the practice of making assertions that assertions aim at truth An assertion by its nature presents what it is saying as true and any assertion which fails to be true is ipso facto liable to criticism whether or not the person making the assertion themself wished to have said something true or to have lied Dummett original discussion of this idea was partially a criticism of deflationism in particular of views of Strawson The idea that we fully explain the concept of truth by way of the Tarski biconditionals is challenged by the claim that the truth assertion platitude is fundamental to truth As Dummett there put it what is left out by the Tarski biconditionals and captured by the truth assertion platitude is the point of the concept of truth or what the concept is used for For further discussion see Glanzberg and Wright Whether or not assertion has such constitutive rules is of course controversial But among those who accept that it does the place of truth in the constitutive rules is itself controversial The leading alternative defended by Williamson is that knowledge not truth is fundamental to the constitutive rules of assertion Williamson defends an account of assertion based on the rule that one must assert only what one knows For more on truth and assertion see the papers in Brown and Cappelen and the entry on assertion Alston William A Realistic Conception of Truth Ithaca Cornell University Press

and frameworks of assessment and that their authority is confined to the context giving rise to them More precisely relativism covers views which maintain that at a high level of abstraction at least some class of things have the properties they have beautiful morally good epistemically justified not simpliciter but only relative to a given framework of assessment local cultural norms individual standards and correspondingly that the truth of claims attributing these properties holds only once the relevant framework of assessment is specified or supplied Relativists characteristically insist furthermore that if something is only relatively so then there can be no framework independent vantage point from which the matter of whether the thing in question is so can be established Relativism has been in its various guises both one of the most popular and most reviled philosophical doctrines of our time Defenders see it as a harbinger of tolerance and the only ethical and epistemic stance worthy of the open minded and tolerant Detractors dismiss it for its alleged incoherence and uncritical intellectual permissiveness Debates about relativism permeate the whole spectrum of philosophical sub disciplines From ethics to epistemology science to religion political theory to ontology theories of meaning and even logic philosophy has felt the need to respond to this heady and seemingly subversive idea Discussions of relativism often also invoke considerations relevant to the very nature and methodology of philosophy and to the division between the so called analytic and continental camps in philosophy And yet despite a long history of debate going back to Plato and an increasingly large body of writing it is still difficult to come to an agreed definition of what at its core relativism is and what philosophical import it has This entry attempts to provide a broad account of the many ways in which relativism has been defined explained defended and criticized Varieties of Relativism New Relativism The label relativism has been attached to a wide range of ideas and positions which may explain the lack of consensus on how the term should be defined The profusion of the use of the term relativism in contemporary philosophy means that there is no ready consensus on any one definition Here are three prominent but not necessarily incompatible approaches A standard way of defining and distinguishing between different types of relativism is to begin with the claim that a phenomenon values epistemic aesthetic and ethical norms experiences judgments and even the world is somehow dependent on and co varies with some underlying independent variable paradigms cultures conceptual schemes belief systems language The type of dependency relativists propose has a bearing on the question of definitions Let us take some examples Each of a exhibits a relation of dependence where a change in the independent variable will result in variations in the dependent variable However of the three examples cited above normally only a and are deemed relevant to philosophical discussions of relativism for one main attraction of relativism is that it offers a way of settling or explaining away what appear to be profound disagreements on questions of value knowledge and ontology and the relativizing parameter often involves people their beliefs cultures or languages The co variance definition proceeds by asking the dual questions what is relativized and ii what is it relativized to The first question enables us to distinguish forms of relativism in terms of their objects for example relativism about truth goodness beauty and their subject matters science law religion The answer to the second question individuates forms of relativism in terms of their domains or frames of reference conceptual frameworks cultures historical periods etc Such classifications have been proposed by Haack Grady Baghramian and Swoyer The following table classifies different relativistic positions according what is being relativized or its objects and what is being relativized to or its domains A A A A New Relativism Table reflects the availability of fine grained distinctions between different forms of relativism as functions of both objects and domains of relativization In practice however much contemporary discussions of relativism focus on subjectivism historicism cultural relativism and conceptual relativism along the axis of and cognitive epistemic relativism ethical or moral relativism and aesthetic relativism along the axis of As we shall see in New Relativism where the objects of relativization in the left column are utterance tokens expressing claims about cognitive norms moral values etc and the domain of relativization is the standards of an assessor has also been the focus of much recent discussion A second approach to defining relativism casts its net more widely by focusing primarily on what relativists deny Defined negatively relativism amounts to the rejection of a number of interconnected philosophical positions Traditionally relativism is contrasted with Absolutism the view that at least some truths or values in the relevant domain apply to all times places or social and cultural frameworks They are universal and not bound by historical or social conditions Absolutism is often used as the key contrast idea to relativism Objectivism or the position that cognitive ethical and aesthetic norms and values in general but truth in particular are independent of judgments and beliefs at particular times and places or in other words they are non trivially mind independent The anti objectivist on the other hand denies that there is such thing as simply being true good tasty or beautiful but argues that we can coherently discuss such values only in relation to parameters that have something to do with our mental lives Monism or the view that in any given area or topic subject to disagreement there can be no more than one correct opinion judgment or norm The relativist often wishes to allow for a plurality of equally valid values or even truths Realism when defined in such a way that it entails both the objectivity and singularity of truth also stands in opposition to relativism Relativism in this negative sense is a prominent feature of the work of the relativists malgr√© eux such as Richard Rorty and Jacques Derrida What justifies the appellation relativist rather than skeptic is not only these philosophers suspicion of the possibility of objectivity but their insistence on the role of socio historical psychological and textual contexts in accounts of truth and knowledge claims What also binds various forms of relativism is an underlying idea that claims to truth knowledge or justification have an implicit maybe even unnoticed relationship to a parameter or domain Gilbert Harman Robert Nozick and Crispin Wright are among the philosophers to propose versions of this thesis Paul Boghossian summarizes the position this way the relativist about a given domain purports to have discovered that the truths of involve an unexpected relation to a parameter Boghossian To take an example moral relativism according to this approach is the claim that the truth or justification of beliefs with moral content is relative to specific moral codes So the sentence It is wrong to sell people as slaves is elliptical for It is wrong to sell people as slaves relative to the moral code of Or alternatively as Kusch formulates the idea on behalf of the relativist It is wrong relative to the moral code of to sell people as slaves The resulting sentence turns out to be true according to the relativist depending on how we fill in the So It is wrong to sell people as slaves comes out true relative to the moral code of the United Nations Charter of Human Rights and false relative to the moral code of ancient Greece The justifying thought is that judgments about the morality of slavery or any other ethical issue are based on differing conventions and there is no universal or objective criterion for choosing among differing competing socio historically constituted conventions Moreover as a corollary of this approach there is no truth of the matter of whether it is wrong to sell people as slaves independently of the specification of some standard Thus on the hidden parameter account a consequence is that the relevant claims will be true if at all only relative to some parameter This particular approach to relativism is often expressed in explicitly linguistic terms and is favored by philosophers interested in the semantic dimensions of relativism The claim is that predicates such as is true is rational is right is good etc in a natural language have the apparent logical form of one place predicates but their surface grammatical form is misleading because upon further investigation they prove to be elliptical for two place predicates such as is true relative to is right according to etc of course where such predicates are available Relativism according to this approach is the claim that a statement of the form A is within a given domain science ethics metaphysics etc is elliptical for the statement A is in relation to where A stands for an assertion belief judgment or action stands for a predicate such as true beautiful right rational logical known etc and stands for a specific culture epistemic framework language belief system etc The three approaches outlined here are compatible and sometimes complementary A relativistic thesis as captured by the approach outlined in for instance will also be relativistic in at least one of the negative senses outlined in Moreover as we shall see since various subdivisions of relativism appearing in table could with appropriate modification be expressed as claims about the truth of sentences falling in a particular domain then the hidden predicate approach is applicable to them as well See for a more detailed way to give expression to the hidden parameter insight within recent work in the philosophy of language A further consideration relevant to defining relativism is its scope The basic idea of global relativism is captured by the oft repeated slogan all is relative The claim is that all beliefs regardless of their subject matter are true only relative to a framework or parameter Local relativists by contrast limit their claim of relativization to self contained areas of discourse ethics aesthetics and taste but argue that for instance scientific truths are not suitable candidates for a relativistic understanding but also see It is worth noting that local relativisms typically are endorsed on the basis of philosophical considerations connected to the kinds of features that are claimed to be relative aesthetic standards epistemic principles or relatedly semantic considerations to do with discourse where such features are attributed Global relativism by contrast seems to be motivated not so much by considerations about particular features but by more general considerations about truth itself As we will see global relativism is open to the charge of inconsistency and self refutation for if all is relative then so is relativism Local relativism is immune from this type of criticism as it need not include its own statement in the scope of what is to be relativized Unsurprisingly local rather than global relativism is much more common within contemporary debates There is also a question mark on whether we could apply relativism to all truths in a completely unrestricted way for instance K√∂lbel has argued that claims such as an object is beautiful and not beautiful and an object is identical to itself have to be excluded A further distinction is made between weak and strong forms of relativism Strong relativism is the claim that one and the same belief or judgment may be true in one context culture or framework or assessment and false in another Weak relativism is the claim that there may be beliefs or judgments that are true in one framework but not true in a second simply because they are not available or expressible in the second Bernard Williams relativism of distance Williams and Ian Hacking defense of variability in styles of reasoning are instances of weak relativism Williams argues that certain concepts are only available to people who live a particular form of life These are concepts that are not a part of what Williams calls the absolute conception of the world and do not express truths that any rational creature regardless of her culture would in principle acknowledge Truths that require these concepts for their formulation are expressible only in languages whose speakers take part in that particular form of life Such truths need not be true in a relativized sense true relative to some parameters false relative to others rather such truths are perspectival real but visible only from a certain angle for people who adopt a certain way of life This weaker form of relativism in so far as it denies the universality of certain truth claims is captured more readily by the negative definition of relativism Interest in relativism as a philosophical doctrine goes back to ancient Greece In more recent decades however relativism has also proven popular not only as a philosophical position but also as an idea underwriting a normative ethical and political outlook see Bloom in particular the Introduction A number of philosophical considerations as well as socio historical developments explain the enduring interest in and the more recent popularity of relativism Data regarding diversity of belief systems conceptual frameworks and ways of life have frequently been used by philosophers and anthropologists alike to give credibility to philosophical arguments for relativism For example see Hollis Lukes and Wilson The mere fact of empirical diversity does not lead to relativism but relativism as a philosophical doctrine has often been taken as a natural position to adopt in light of empirical diversity in part because relativism helps to make sense of such diversity without the burden of explaining who is in error Descriptive relativism an empirical and methodological position adopted by social anthropologists relies on ethnographic data to highlight the paucity of universally agreed upon norms values and explanatory frameworks From polygamy to cannibalism from witchcraft to science we find major differences between the worldviews and outlooks of individuals and groups Descriptive relativism is often used as the starting point for philosophical debates on relativism in general and cultural relativism in particular The observed radical differences among cultures it is argued show the need for a relativistic assessment of value systems and conceptual commitments Some anti relativist universalists on the other hand argue that underlying the apparent individual and cultural differences there are some core commonalities to all belief systems and socio cultural outlooks Nussbaum But the relativistically inclined respond by first pointing to the seeming incommensurability of various ethical and conceptual frameworks and the variability of cognitive norms and practices in difference cultures and then on this basis maintain that the so called commonalities belie significant differences The anti relativist may concede the point and insist that where such disagreements exist at most one view is correct and the rest mistaken But in so far as we are reluctant to impute widespread and systematic error to other cultures or to our own relativism remains an attractive option Descriptive relativism is also central to the brand of relativism advocated by the sociologists of scientific knowledge and other social constructionists who argue that even in the so called hard sciences we cannot escape the specter of irresolvable differences and even incommensurability see There is not only a marked diversity of views on questions of right and wrong truth and falsehood etc but more significantly many disputes arising from such differences seem intractable There are instances of long standing disagreement such that the disputants are very plausibly talking about the same subject matter thus avoiding incommensurability and genuinely disagreeing with each other and yet no amount of information and debate enables them or us to resolve the disagreement And moreover in such cases it can seem that neither side seems to have made any obvious mistake see Hales If well informed honest and intelligent people are unable to resolve conflicts of opinion we should some relativists argue accept that all parties to such disputes could be right and their conflicting positions have equal claims to truth each according to their own perspective or point of view Their disagreement is faultless K√∂lbel Brogaard Hales Many relativistically inclined philosophers Max K√∂lbel Wright and John MacFarlane with terminological qualification see the presence of faultless disagreements as central to motivating and justifying relativism The anti relativists counter that the very notion of a faultless disagreement is incompatible with our common understanding of what it means to disagree It is a hallmark of disagreement as commonly understood that the parties involved find fault with the other sides views When people disagree at least one of them is making a mistake or is failing to believe what he or she ought to believe given his or her cognitive aims Relativism accordingly offers a revisionary account of what it means to disagree MacFarlane see where the point has been discussed in some detail but it is not clear if the account can explain what is left of a disagreement to preserve once we allow that both parties to a disagreement could be right Carter Dreier A sophisticated semantic version of relativism about truth known as truth relativism and alternatively as new relativism has been proposed in recent years and which attempts to deal with some of these issues MacFarlane We will return to this variety of relativism in A different perspective on the move from disagreement to relativism is offered in recent work by Carol Rovane and who rejects the prevailing consensus on what she calls the disagreement intuition of relativism in favor of an alternatives intuition According to Rovane relativism is motivated by the existence of truths that cannot be embraced together not because they contradict and hence disagree with each other but because they are not universal truths The example Rovane gives is conflict between a belief that deference to parents is morally obligatory in Indian traditionalist sense and the belief that it is not morally obligatory in the American individualist sense Each belief is true within its particular ethical framework but the two beliefs cannot be conjoined or embraced together Or more generally it is not possible both to exercise full autonomy and simultaneously be dedicated to one community and its norms The underlying thought for Rovane is that not all truth value bearers are in logical relations to one another that there are many noncomprehensive bodies of truths that cannot be conjoined What the two approaches have in common is the claim that truth and justification are plural that there could be more than one correct account of how things stand in at least some domains and their correctness has to be decided relative to a framework of context of assessment Additionally the relativistically inclined find further support for their position in the contention that there is no meta justification of our evaluative or normative systems that all justifications have to start and end somewhere see Sankey and and that there are no higher order or meta level standards available for adjudicating clashes between systems in a non question begging way Steven Hales for instance argues that faced with disagreement and given non neutrality relativism is the most viable non skeptical conclusion to draw Hales Similar considerations apply to attempts to anchor beliefs on secure foundations Various intellectual developments leading to loss of old certainties in the scientific and social arena have strengthened the appeal of this point The scientific revolution of the early century brought about by for instance the advent of Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics and the loss of faith in lasting religious or political truths Marxism in particular as well as the failure of foundationalist philosophical programs have been used in arguments to vindicate relativistic views for relativism about science see The relativists often argue that justifications are not only perspectival but also interest relative and there is no neutral or objective starting ground for any of our beliefs see Seidel Carter ch and Siegel in Hales for criticisms of this type of justification of relativism Pierre Durham thesis of underdetermination of theory by data the claim that empirical evidence alone is not adequate for providing justification for any given scientific theory has played an important role in building up a case both for conceptual relativism and for constructionism and relativism about science and According to the underdetermination thesis incompatible theories can be consistent with available evidence Relativism threatens whenever conflicting theories or views appear to have equal claim to truth or justification The relativistically inclined use underdetermination to claim that evidence could be brought to justify opposing explanations and justification The underdetermination thesis is also used to highlight the absence of neutral starting points for our beliefs Choices between incompatible but equally well supported rival theories it is argued are often made based on interests and local preferences rather than neutral universal grounds Relativists argue that beliefs and values get their justification or truth only relative to specific epistemic systems or practices see Kusch forthcoming Strong support for this view has come from social scientists and cultural theorist who focus on the socio cultural determinants of human beliefs and actions The social sciences from their very inception were hospitable to relativism Indeed August Comte the father of sociology claimed that a strength of positive sociology was its tendency to render relative the ideas which were at first absolute Comte Comte also was responsible for the battle cry all is relative but immediately and no doubt self consciously contradicted himself by adding and that the only absolute Other social scientists under the influence of Karl Marx Max Weber and Wilhelm Dilthey have given credence to the idea that human beliefs and actions could be understood and evaluated only relative to their social and economic background and context Beliefs desires and actions the argument goes are never independent of a background of cultural presuppositions interests and values We cannot step out of our language culture and socio historical conditions to survey reality from an Archimedean vantage point Even perceptions are theory laden and could vary between linguistic and cultural groupings The sociological view that beliefs are context dependent in the sense that their context helps explain why people have the beliefs they do has also been used to support what is sometimes called social or sociological relativism or the view that truth or correctness is relative to social contexts because we can both understand and judge beliefs and values only relative to the context out of which they arise Context dependence is also used to explain empirical observations of diversity in beliefs and values different social contexts the argument goes give rise to differing possibly incompatible norms and values Advocates of relativism particularly outside philosophical circles often cite tolerance as a key normative reason for becoming a relativist On this rationale all ways of life and cultures are worthy of respect in their own terms and it is a sign of unacceptable ethnocentrism to presume that we could single out one outlook or point of view as objectively superior to others The Principle of Tolerance acquires an overtly socio political form in the hand of Paul Feyerabend who maintains that A free society is a society in which all traditions are given equal rights Anti relativists find this normative advocacy of relativism unconvincing for two key kinds of reasons Some anti relativists Rachels often appeal to cases at the limits toleration of heinous crimes to show the thesis to be implausibly overpermissive see Others argue that if all values are relative then tolerance and maximizing freedom are valuable only to those who have already embraced them Relativists counter that they are not defending a global version of relativism regarding all truths and justification but local versions concerning the ethics and politics of belief and the usefulness of relativism in our attempt to become better or at least more flexible and less dogmatic thinkers and more tolerant citizens Feyerabend The anti relativists counter argue that even if we grant that political tolerance is an important value and that accepting relativism would promote it we should never adopt philosophical views about the nature of truth or justification simply because of their assumed good moral or political consequences Second and more importantly political toleration does not require the strong and doctrine of philosophical relativism Increased awareness of diversity together with an awareness of the historical contingency of one own convictions will promote political toleration just as effectively As Knobe and Nichols point out simply being made aware of radically different view points can lead to a crisis akin to that of the Christian child confronted with religious diversity For the discovery of religious diversity can prompt the thought that it in some sense accidental that one happens to be raised in a Christian household rather than a Hindu household This kind of arbitrariness can make the child wonder whether there any reason to think that his religious beliefs are more likely to be right than those of the Hindu child Knobe Nichols The English term relativism came into usage only in the Century John Grote was probably the first to employ it when in Exploratio Philosophica he wrote The notion of the mask over the face of nature is what I have called relativism If the face of nature is reality then the mask over it which is what theory gives us is so much deception and that is what relativism really comes to Grote I xi Its German counterpart Relativismus has a longer history Wilhelm Traugott Krug who succeeded Kant in the University of Konisberg in his philosophical lexicon defines it as the assumption that everything which we experience and think the self the idea of reason truth morality religion etc is only something relative and therefore has no essential endurance and no universal validity Krug Although the term relativism is of recent coinage doctrines and positions with some of the hallmarks of contemporary relativism date back to the very beginnings of Western philosophy Protagoras of Abdera BC is often considered the first overt champion of relativism and his dictum Man anthr√¥pos is the measure metron of all things chr√™mat√¥n of the things which are that they are and of the things which are not that they are not t√¥n men ont√¥n h√¥s esti t√¥n de m√™ ont√¥n h√¥s ouk estin from Plato Theaetetus its first battle cry According to Plato Protagoras thought Each thing appears phainesthai to me so it is for me and as it appears to you so it is for you you and I each being a man Theaetetus For instance the same wind could be cold to one person and hot to another The extent to which Protagoras view or at least what comes down to us from Plato amounts to genuine relativism remains somewhat controversial As Burnyeat notes Sextus Empiricus thought though Burnyeat thinks mistakenly that the Protagorean measure doctrine was to be understood as the subjectivist thesis that every appearance is true simpliciter This kind of radical subjectivism though quickly can be shown to turn on itself it can appear that the thesis that every appearance is true is false And so this radical subjectivist interpretation regardless of whether it is accurate is as Sextus had thought untenable However Plato also ascribes a social or ethical dimension to Protagorean relativism which seem to go beyond individualistic subjectivism In Theaetetus he says what may or may not fittingly be done of just and unjust of what is sanctioned by religion and what is not and here the theory may be prepared to maintain that whatever view a city takes on these matters and establishes as its law or convention is truth and fact for that city In such matters neither any individual nor any city can claim superior wisdom emphasis added Plato attempted refutation of Protagoras known as peritrope or turning around is the first of the many attempts to show that relativism is self refuting Protagorean relativism directly influenced the Pyrrhonian Skeptics who saw the man is the measure doctrine as a precursor to their brand of skepticism Sextus Empiricus for instance in his Relativity Mode states that judgments and observations are relative to the person who makes them to their context as well as the object being observed and goes on to say since we have established in this way that everything is relative pros ti it is clear then that we shall not be able to say what an existing object is like in its own nature and purely but only what it appears to be like relative to something Sextus Empiricus PH I But the conclusion he draws favors skepticism rather than relativism as understood in modern philosophy for he concludes It follows that we must suspend judgment about the nature of objects ibid Glimpses of relativistic thinking were in evidence in Boethius see Marenbon as well as in the double truth doctrine or the view that religion and philosophy are separate and at times conflicting sources of truth originally found in Averroes and the century Latin Averroists However the dominant belief in a singular and absolute revealed truth within a Christian framework on the whole made the medieval period inhospitable to relativism There was a renewed interest in both relativism and skepticism at the inception of modern philosophy inspired in part by Latin translations of Sextus Empiricus in the century Michel de Montaigne work in common with others sympathetic towards relativism ancient or contemporary relies on accounts of faraway cultures to argue that we have no other criterion of truth or right reason than the example and form of the opinion and customs of our own country Montaigne but also see Fricker for a dissenting view His advocacy of toleration even for the cannibal paved the way for not only the acceptance but the valorization of idealized versions of alien creeds and distant cultures by Enlightenment figures such as Rousseau Voltaire Diderot Montesquieu and Condorcet who in turn were instrumental in establishing an intellectual climate hospitable to cultural relativism These authors were also the first to explore the idea of viewing one culture from an outsider point of view and using this external perspective as a vehicle to criticize local customs and norms To take just one example Diderot in his Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville tells us that the Tahitian is mild innocent and happy while civilized people are corrupt vile and wretched the natives live according to customs and rules that vary greatly from the Western ones They do not possess private property or operate their affairs based on egalitarian principles and they exercise sexual freedom not accepted in civilized societies Diderot accordingly opposes the European mission of civilizing the natives and despite his belief in a common human nature he advocates the relativistic sounding maxim to be monks in France and savages in Tahiti Put on the costume of the country you visit but keep the suit of clothes you will need to go home in Diderot in Baghramian Discussions of relativism in the century had two sources see Gardiner On the one hand figures from the so called Counter Enlightenment a philosophical movement which arose in the late century and the early century in opposition to the Enlightenment Johann Georg Hamann Johann Gottfried Herder Wilhelm von Humboldt emphasized the diversity of languages and customs and their role in shaping human thought Hamann views on language for instance foreshadow contemporary conceptual and epistemic relativism He maintained that language is the instrument and criterion of reason as well as the source of all the confusions and fallacies of reason Furthermore the rules of rationality are embedded within language which in turn is governed by local norms of custom and use Hamann Relativism ensues because languages and their rules of rationality vary a great deal Herder on the other hand not only railed against the rational universalizing and science oriented ethos of the Enlightenment but much like later relativists also argued that different nations and epochs have their distinct preferences in ethical and aesthetics matters as well as their varied conceptions of truth and we are not in a position to adjudicate between them Herder The Counter Enlightenment had a significant influence on Hegel Nietzsche and Dilthey who in turn have shaped relativistic thinking in certain strands of continental philosophy postmodernism and cultural studies Hamann rejection of objectivism was central to Nietzsche even more profound recoil from objectivity And indeed Nietzsche is possibly the single most influential voice in shaping relativistic sensibilities in century continental philosophy His declaration that all human conceptions and descriptions including those advanced by scientists are only an interpretation and arrangement of the world according to our own requirements if I may say so and not an explanation of the world Nietzsche and that there is only a perspective seeing only a perspective knowing Nietzsche irrespective of how Nietzsche himself intended them have been taken to express a core contention of relativism that no single account of truth or reality can occupy a privileged position for such accounts are only one of many perspectives that prevail at a given time in history We cannot appeal to any facts or standards of evaluation independently of their relation to the perspectives available to us we can do little more than to insist on the legitimacy of our own perspective and try to impose it on other people through our will to power A second source was the German post Kantian and British Idealist discussions of the relativity of knowledge taking place in the context of the distinction between being for other f√ºr anderes sein and being for itself f√ºrsichsein a distinction influenced by the Kantian idea that all knowledge is ultimately relational because knowledge of the Real or the thing in itself is impossible John Stuart Mill for instance ascribes to the Kantian William Hamilton the doctrine of relativity of our human knowledge because Hamilton according to Mill believed that there could be no unconditional or absolute knowledge for all knowledge is dependent on the knowing mind Mill The end of century witnessed the emergence of yet another strand of relativism motivated by empirical psychological and physiological interpretations of Kantian categories The view known as species relativism and defended by neo Kantian psychologists such as Theodore Lipps holds that the rules of logic are products of the human mind and psychology and therefore may be unique to the human species different species could have and use different logical principles The view was vehemently but quite effectively attacked by and Frege and Husserl as part of their arguments against what they called psychologism and speciesm Kusch Logic in this approach is identified with the actual thinking processes of individuals or communities and its authority is seen to be local or relative to the practices of particular epistemic groupings But Frege and Husserl argued that with such relativization we would lose the ability to distinguish between reasoning correctly and merely seeming to do so Finally the popularity of the very idea of relativism in the century owes something to Einstein Special Theory of Relativity which was to be used both as model and as well as a vindication for various relativistic claims Gilbert Harman is among the philosophers to use Einsteinian relativity as a model for philosophical versions of relativism He says According to Einstein Theory of Relativity even an object mass is relative to a choice of spatio temporal framework An object can have one mass in relation to one such framework and a different mass in relation to another I am going to argue for a similar claim about moral right and wrong I am going to argue that moral right and wrong are always relative to a choice of moral framework Harman The Sapir Whorf theory of linguistic relativity see is also thought to have been inspired by the Relativity Theory It is however worth noting that Einstein did not think that the Theory of Relativity supported relativism in ethics or epistemology because although in his model simultaneity and sameness of place are relative to reference frames the physical laws expressing such relativity are constant and universal and hence in no sense relative The different strands of the intellectual genealogy of relativism have shaped a variety of relativistic doctrines Relativism is discussed under a variety of headings some of which have been more prominent in recent philosophical and cultural debates Public debates about relativism often revolve around the frequently cited but unclear notion of cultural relativism The idea that norms and values are born out of conventions can be traced back to the Greek historian Herodotus BC but it is only in the century and particularly with the advent of social anthropology that cultural relativism has gained wide currency Franz Boas responsible for the founding of social anthropology in the claimed that The data of ethnology prove that not only our knowledge but also our emotions are the result of the form of our social life and of the history of the people to whom we belong Boas Boas views became the orthodoxy of anthropology through Herskovits principle of cultural relativism stating Judgments are based on experience and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation Herskovits Since those early days social anthropologists have come to develop more nuanced approaches to cultural relativism see for instance Geertz however its core tenet a claim to the equal standing of all cultural perspectives and values which co vary with their cultural and social background has remained constant Cultural relativists justify their position by recourse to a combination of empirical conceptual and normative considerations a The empirical observation that there is a significant degree of diversity in norms values and beliefs across cultures and historic periods known as descriptive relativism see An inductive argument to the effect that failures in previous attempts to resolve disagreements arising from a show that there are no universal criteria for adjudicating between differing world views The methodological assumption that human behavior and thought carry the imprint of their cultural and social context such that biology by itself is not sufficient for explaining many of their most important features especially those with respect to which cultures differ The normative principle of a need for tolerance and acceptance towards other points of view see which leads to so called normative or prescriptive cultural relativism or the positions that cultural relativism is a moral requirement see also normative moral relativism in Claims a are open to a variety of objections Some anthropologists and biologists have argued against the empirical assumption of the variability of cultures and have disputed its extent Kinship death and its attendant rituals of mourning birth the experience of empathy expressions of sympathy and fear and the biological needs that give rise to these are some of the constant elements of human experience that belie the seeming diversity reported by ethnographers Brown has also been challenged by naturalistically inclined social scientists who believe that an evolutionary or a biologically informed approach can provide a context independent universally applicable theoretical framework for explaining what is common to all cultures despite their superficial differences Moreover Moody Adams among others has argued that cultures are not integrated wholes that could determine uni directionally the beliefs and experiences of their members they are porous riddled with inconsistencies and amenable to change Finally is under pressure from the very relativism it advocates Other critics Pope Benedict XVI for instance in his very first homily delivered upon election April reject and condemn prescriptive cultural relativism as a harbinger of nihilism and an anything goes extreme permissiveness An influential form of descriptive cultural relativism owes its genesis to linguistics Benjamin Whorf inspired by his teacher Edward Sapir who in turn was supervised by the social anthropologist Fran Boas used ethnographic evidence from American Indian languages such as Hopi to argue that languages mold our views of the world and different languages do so differently because we dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages Whorf In the case of the Hopi the claim was that their language imposes a conception of time very different from that of the speakers of the Indo European languages The so called Sapir Whorf hypothesis and the position known as linguistic relativity became popular in both psychology and social anthropology in the mid century However the empirical work by the psychologists Berlin and Key and later by Eleanor Rosch pointed to the universality of color terms The linguistic theories of Noam Chomsky regarding the universality of grammar were also widely taken to have discredited linguistic relativity Moreover Malotki had argued that contrary to Whorf claim the Hopi language does indeed have tense as well as units of time such as days weeks months and seasons and terminology for yesterday and tomorrow Things have changed recently and there has been a slight swing of the pendulum back in favor of linguistic relativity on the part of so called neo Whorfians Stephen Levinson for instance drawing on experimental evidence has argued that the frame of reference that underlies any given language shapes our spatial experiences and perceptual modalities see Gumperz Levinson Similar claims have been made about emotions object representation and memory But the claims of linguistic relativity in all these cases are much more modest than Whorf original thesis Historical relativism or historicism is the diachronic version of cultural relativism As Clifford Geertz points out cultural and historical relativism are in effect the same doctrine with a core claim that we cannot apprehend another people or another period imagination neatly as though it were our own Historicism originated in reaction to the universalist tendencies of the Enlightenment but proved most influential in the social sciences particularly in the hands of century theorists such as Karl Marx and Max Weber Oswald Spengler the then influential turn of the century German historian and philosopher also declared that There are no eternal truths Every philosophy is an expression of its time Spengler Karl Mannheim to whom we owe the sub discipline of sociology of knowledge pronounced that historicism is a significant intellectual force that epitomizes our worldview Weltanschauung The historicist principle not only organizes like an invisible hand the work of the cultural sciences Geisteswissenschaften but also permeates everyday thinking Mannheim As we will see in more recent times historicist interpretations of science chiefly those espoused by Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend have played a major role in popularizing relativistic interpretations of scientific knowledge Conceptual relativism is a narrowly delineated form of relativism where ontology or what exists rather than ethical and epistemic norms is relativized to conceptual schemes scientific paradigms or categorical frameworks In this sense conceptual relativism is often characterized as a metaphysical doctrine rather than as variant of epistemic or cultural relativism The underlying rationale for this form of relativism is the anti realist thesis that the world does not present itself to us ready made or ready carved rather we supply different and at times incompatible ways of categorizing and conceptualizing it Reflection on the connections between mind and the world rather than empirical observations of historic and cultural diversity is the primary engine driving various forms of conceptual relativism but data from anthropology and linguistics are also used in its support The thought at least since Kant is that the human mind is not a passive faculty merely representing an independent reality rather it has an active role in shaping if not constructing the real The conceptual relativist adds as Kant did not that human beings may construct the real in different ways thanks to differences in language or culture In the century a variety of positions sympathetic to conceptual relativism were developed Quine ontological relativity Nelson Goodman irrealism with its claim of the plurality of world versions and Hilary Putnam conceptual relativity are prominent examples What these authors have in common is an insistence that there could be more than one right way of describing what there is that incompatible manuals of translation and world versions can be equally correct or acceptable Quine thesis of ontological relativity probably the most influential of century approaches to conceptual relativity is expressed both in an epistemic as well as in a stronger metaphysical form Quine supports an epistemic thesis when he claims that incompatible scientific theories can account equally adequately for the data available to us his underdetermination thesis and that there are various defensible ways of conceiving the world Quine But his thesis of the indeterminacy of translation makes the stronger claim that different incompatible manuals of translation or conceptual schemes can account for one and the same verbal behavior and the indeterminacy resides at the level of facts rather than our knowledge a position that leads to unavoidable ontological relativity Nelson Goodman irrealism is an even more radical claim to the effect that the existence of many adequate and indeed correct but irreconcilable descriptions and representations of the world shows that there is no such thing as one unique actual world rather there are many worlds one for each correct description Goodman cf Sider Hilary Putnam disagrees with Goodman formulation of relativity with its radical talk of world making but relies on arguments from conceptual plurality to reject metaphysical realism the view that there is one single correct account of what the world is like According to Putnam our most basic metaphysical categories objecthood and existence could be defined variously depending on what conceptual scheme we use What counts as an object itself he argues is determined by and hence is relative to the ontological framework we opt for Thomas Kuhn highly influential discussion of the governing role of paradigms in science see has also been interpreted as a form of conceptual relativism by friends Kusch and critics Davidson of relativism alike The key difficulty facing conceptual relativism is that of formulating the position in a coherent but non trivial manner Trivial versions allow that the world can be described in different ways but make no claims to the incompatibility of these descriptions The charge of incoherence arises from the claim that there could be genuinely conflicting and equally true accounts or descriptions of one and the same phenomenon To use an example that is the corner stone of Hilary Putnam conceptual relativity Putnam claims that the simple question how many objects there are say on a given table could be answered variously depending on whether we use a mereological or a Carnapian common sense method of individuating objects In circumstances where a Carnapian counts three objects A and a mereologist will count seven A plus the mereological sum objects A A A As Putnam puts it The suggestion is that what is by commonsense standards the same situation can be described in many different ways depending on how we use the words The situation does not itself legislate how words like object entity and exist must be used What is wrong with the notion of objects existing independently of conceptual schemes is that there are no standards for the use of even the logical notions apart from conceptual choices Putnam The puzzle is to explain how both the Carnapian and mereological answers to the one and same question could be correct and yet mutually incompatible for unless we abandon the most fundamental law of logic the law of non contradiction we cannot deem one and the same proposition true and not true Relativists respond that both answers are correct each relative to the conceptual scheme it invokes So once we accept the insight that there is no Archimedean vantage point for choosing among conflicting frameworks we no longer face a genuine contradiction The response invokes often implicitly a relativized conception of truth which as we shall see below faces its own difficulties Relativism about truth or alethic relativism at its simplest is the claim that what is true for one individual or social group may not be true for another and there is no context independent vantage point to adjudicate the matter What is true or false is always relative to a conceptual cultural or linguistic framework Alethic relativism is the most central of all relativistic positions since other subdivisions of the philosophical theses of relativism with the possible exception of some narrowly defined versions of conceptual relativism such as Nelson Goodman irrealism see are in principle reducible to it Baghramian For instance relativism about logic may be restated as a view according to which the standing of logical truths including truths about consequence relations is relative to cultures or cognitive schemes Ethical relativism can be seen as the claim that the truth of ethical judgments if such truths exist is relative to context or culture If truth is to be seen as equally applicable to all areas of discourse and also unitary rather than domain specific or plural then alethic relativism is not only a strong form of global relativism but it also entails the denial of the possibility of more local forms of relativism because all localized relativistic claims are also attempts at relativizing truth seemingly in a particular domain of discourse The central claim of the alethic relativism is that is true despite appearances to the contrary is at least in some relevant domains of discourse not a one place but a two place predicate such that is true should correctly be understood as modulo differences in particular ways of developing this idea shorthand for is true for where is a culture conceptual scheme belief framework etc And within the broad camp of alethic relativists the matter of how it is that which we should opt for is true for rather than is true simpliciter is developed in different ways see Meiland MacFarlane ch Egan One shared commitment of relativizing the truth predicate is that claims such as misfortune is caused by witchcraft could be true according to the Azande cultural framework and false in the Western scientific framework One major difficulty facing alethic relativists is to explain what true for actually means and how true for should be understood as related to the more familiar absolutist truth predicate For instance should relative truth be understood as a modification on an already familiar strategy for thinking about truth the correspondence pragmatic or epistemic model or in some different way entirely MacFarlane ch Much of the work of New Relativists such as John MacFarlane see can be see as an attempt to clarify this thorny issue The strongest and most persistent charge leveled against all types of relativism but global alethic relativism in particular is the accusation of self refutation Here is for instance Harvey Siegel This incoherence charge is by far the most difficult problem facing the relativist It is worth noting that attempts to overcome the problem by appealing to the notion of relative truth appear not to succeed Many versions of relativism rely on such a notion but it is very difficult to make sense of it An assertion that a proposition is true for me or true for members of my culture is more readily understood as a claim concerning what I or members of my culture scheme etc believe than it is as a claim ascribing to that proposition some special sort of truth Constructing a conception of relative truth such that is relatively true or is true for or is true for members of culture amounts to something stronger than believes that or members of culture believe that but weaker than is true simpliciter has proved to be quite difficult and is arguably beyond the conceptual resources available to the relativist Siegel The original argument goes back to Plato criticism of Protagoras in the Theaetetus where he argues Most people believe that Protagoras doctrine is false Protagoras on the other hand believes his doctrine to be true By his own doctrine Protagoras must believe that his opponents view is true Therefore Protagoras must believe that his own doctrine is false see Theaetetus Plato argument as it stands appears to be damaging only if we assume that Protagoras at least implicitly is committed to the universal or objective truth of relativism On this view Plato begs the question on behalf of an absolutist conception of truth Burnyeat Protagoras the relativists counter could indeed accept that his own doctrine is false for those who accept absolutism but continue believing that his doctrine is true for him He could also try to persuade others to become the sort of thinker for whom relativism is true without being entangled in self contradiction Such an effort at persuasions however could involve Protagoras in a performative contradiction as the relativist cannot assume that her arguments are good for persuading others Ordinarily the very act of defending a philosophical position commits us to the dialectical move of attempting to convince our interlocutors of the superior value of what we are arguing for The relativist cannot make such a commitment and therefore his attempts to persuade others to accept his position may be pragmatically self refuting The relativist can avoid the standard charge of self refutation by accepting that relativism cannot be proven true in any non relative sense viz that relativism itself as a philosophical position is at best true only relative to a cultural or historical context and therefore could be false in other frameworks or cultures But such an admission will undermine the relativist attempt to convince others of her position for the very act of argumentation as it is commonly understood is an attempt to convince those who disagree with us of the falsehood of their position In other words if Protagoras really believes in relativism why would he bother to argue for it It may be argued that Protagoras could have opted for a more sensible form of alethic relativism where a person beliefs are not automatically true relative to the framework she accepts Rather a belief is true according to framework iff roughly would believe that if she were to reason cogently by her own standards on the basis of full relevant information This form of alethic relativism allows for argument and persuasion among people who initially disagree for despite their disagreement they may share or come to share a framework Protagoras may on this reinterpretation be trying to persuade his interlocutor that if she were to reason cogently by her own standards from their shared framework she would accept relativism However it is not clear how the relativist could share a framework with the absolutist on the nature of truth or what argumentative strategies he can use to convert the absolutist without presupposing a shared relativist or absolutist conceptions of truth In particular a consistent relativist will have only a relativized criteria of what counts as true information which presumably will not be shared by the absolutist A second strand of the self refutation argument focuses on the nature and role of truth Mackie for instance has argued that alethic absolutism is a requisite of a coherent notion of truth and that a claim to the effect that There are no absolute truths is absolutely self refuting Mackie But the relativists reject the quick move that presupposes the very conception of truth they are at pains to undermine and have offered sophisticated approaches of defense A good example of such a defense is Hales who uses a operator to represent It is true in some perspectives that and a operator to represent It is true in all perspectives that in order to establish that there could indeed be a consistent relativist logic which avoids the charge of self refutation Key to this approach according to Hales is that we abandon a conception of global relativism on which the lose thesis everything is relative is embraced a thesis Hales concedes to be inconsistent for the thesis everything that is true is relatively true which he maintains is not cf Shogenji for a criticism of Hales on this point It has also been claimed that alethic relativism gives rise to what Mackie calls operational Mackie and Max K√∂lbel conversational self refutation K√∂lbel by flouting one or more crucial norms of discourse and thereby undermines the very possibility of coherent discourse One version of the argument advanced most notably by Gareth Evans begins with the premise that a publicly shared distinction between correct and incorrect and hence true and false assertion is a necessary condition for coherent assertoric discourse As Evans puts it a theory that permits a subject to deduce merely that a particular utterance is now correct but later will be incorrect cannot assist the subject in deciding what to say nor in interpreting the remarks of others What should we aim at or take others to be aiming at And if truth is relative then there is no single shared definite aim for any given assertion see MacFarlane ch for a discussion The relativists however could respond that truth is relative to a group conceptual scheme framework and they take speakers to be aiming a truth relative to the scheme that they and their interlocutors are presumed to share The difficulty with this approach is that it seems to make communication across frameworks impossible Such a response however will be answerable to the charge of incoherence raised by Donald Davidson against both alethic and conceptual relativism According to Davidson the principle of charity the assumption that other speakers by and large speak truly by our lights is a pre requisite of all interpretation He takes this to imply that there could not be languages or conceptual schemes that we cannot in principle understand and interpret in other words if a system of signs is not recognizable as a language by us then is not a language Languages are either inter translatable and hence not radically different from ours or incommensurable and beyond our ability to recognize them as languages Davidson The relativist in effect places other speakers and their languages beyond our recognitional reach and thereby undermines the initial claim that they could be radically different or incommensurable New Relativism as we shall see offers a novel take on the old question of alethic relativism and gives weight to Alasdair MacIntyre observation that relativism may have been refuted a number of times too often whereas genuinely refutable doctrines only need to be refuted once MacIntyre Claims to knowledge and justification have proven receptive to relativistic interpretations Epistemic relativism is the thesis that cognitive norms that determine what counts as knowledge or whether a belief is rational justifiable etc could vary with and are dependent on local conceptual or cultural frameworks and lack the universality they aspire or pretend to The three key assumptions underlying epistemic relativism are a Epistemic justification is framework relative It makes no sense to ask whether a belief is justified simpliciter we can only ask questions about justification relative to an epistemic system which casts doubts on the very possibility of objectivity There are many genuinely alternative even incompatible epistemic systems We cannot demonstrate in a non circular way that our epistemic system is superior to any other see Williams for one version of this approach to epistemic relativism cf Carter The epistemic relativist as Paul Boghossian in developing his trenchant criticisms of relativism points out is committed to a doctrine of equal validity the view that there are many radically different incompatible yet equally valid ways of knowing the world with science being just one of them Boghossian The relativist key claim is that either we can chauvinistically maintain that our epistemic system is superior to all or accept the equal legitimacy of varying epistemic systems One crucial question facing epistemic relativism is how to identify and individuate alternative epistemic systems The intuitive idea is that varying and possibly incompatible cognitive principles ground level beliefs and presuppositions or what Wittgenstein calls hinge and bedrock propositions Wittgenstein separate non convergent epistemic schemes A simple and quite commonly used example is the contrast between scientific and religious belief systems Boghossian for instance uses the debate between Galileo and Cardinal Bellarmine as a case study of an encounter between antagonists operating within putatively different epistemic frameworks who use different frameworks or as Rorty put it grids for determining what would count as appropriate evidence on planetary movements The relativist claims that there is no fact of the matter about whether the Copernican theory or the geocentric view is justified by the evidence for there are no absolute facts about what justifies what Boghossian while the anti relativist attempts to show the unintelligibility or the implausibility of such a claim Boghossian has been criticized however for his characterization of epistemic relativism One notable such criticism has been advanced by Crispin Wright who takes issue with Boghossian attributing to the epistemic relativist a version of a above what Boghossian calls epistemic relationism or the thesis that any claim of the form Evidence justifies belief if it is to have any prospect of being true must be construed as expressing the claim According to the epistemic system that I accept information justifies belief Boghossian Having characterized the relativist position in this fashion Boghossian suggests after considering various ways of articulating what the relativist might say about the untruth of claims of the form Evidence justifies belief that the relativist is left ultimately with no coherent way to account for how she should count as accepting or adhering to a given epistemic system And on this basis Boghossian concludes that there is no coherent way to formulate the position because the relativist in formulating his position and setting up the opposition between two or more alternative non convergent epistemic systems cannot but assume the universality of at least some epistemic principles including deduction induction warrant through empirical evidence etc see Boghossian As Wright sees it however Boghossian attributing the relationist clause to the epistemic relativist is to simply fail to take seriously the thesis that claims such as Evidence justifies belief can indeed by true or false albeit only relatively so Wright our italics Moreover Wright argues the epistemic relationist clause Boghossian includes in the kind of epistemic relativism he challenges betrays a failure to distinguish between making a judgment in the light of certain standards and ii judging that those standards mandate that judgment See also MacFarlane for a different critique of Boghossian argument against the epistemic relativist Conceptions of rationality and its key components of logic and and justification are some of the principles that are often used to differentiate between epistemic systems Below we look at attempts at relativizing each Earlier defenses of epistemic relativism centered on the idea of alternative rationalities and were often developed as a reaction to the charge of irrationality leveled at non Western tribal people Rationality traditionally is seen as a cognitive virtue as well as a hallmark of the scientific method The complex notion of rationality is intimately tied to requirements of consistency justification warrant and evidence for beliefs Relativists about rationality cast doubt on the universal applicability of one or more of these features of rational thought and deem them merely local epistemic values Peter Winch treatment of Evans Pritchard account of the Azande tribe beliefs in witchcraft and magic is now a classic of the rationality wars of the and Winch had argued that since standards of rationality in different societies do not always coincide we should use only contextually and internally given criteria of rationality in our assessment of the systems of belief of other cultures and societies Under the influence of the later Wittgenstein he maintained that it does not make sense to speak of a universal standard of rationality because what is rational is decided by a backdrop of norms governing a given language and form of life As outside observers we are not in a position to impute irrationality or illogicality to the Azande or any other group whose practices and language games may differ from ours Critics of Winch Steven Lukes for instance using considerations reminiscent of Davidson principle of charity have argued that we will not be in a position to understand a language or culture with standards of rationality radically different from ours and that we must have at least some core principles or what Martin Hollis had called a bridgehead with elements such as consistency and the goal of truth in common with the Azande in order to understand them Hollis Lukes They thereby conclude that an all out or strong relativism about rationality is not tenable The weaker claim is that some elements of rationality for instance what counts as good evidence or a better style of reasoning could vary with historic conditions and traditions of enquiry and therefore a degree of relativization of such norms without succumbing to irrationalism is acceptable see Hacking and MacIntyre Being rational also means having warrant in the form of good reasons and justification for one beliefs Epistemic relativists maintain that the legitimacy of a justificatory system and the presumed strength of epistemic warrants are decided locally Richard Rorty has made the influential claim that there is nothing to be said about either truth or rationality apart from descriptions of the familiar procedures of justification which a given society ours uses in one or another area of inquiry Rorty For Rorty warrant is a sociological matter to be ascertained by observing the reception of a speaker statement by her peers Rorty also claims that knowledge and truth are compliments paid to beliefs which we think so well justified that for the moment further justification is not needed Rorty where the we is historically conditioned community of enquirers Rorty rejects the label relativist because he insists that unlike the relativists he does not subscribe to the view that all beliefs are equally true or good He calls his position ethnocentrism because the only form of warrant available to any of us is the one provided through solidarity with our peers His rejection of the label relativist has had little effect on critics such as Hilary Putnam or Paul Boghossian who do not see the distinction Rorty wishes to draw between his brand of ethnocentrism and relativism Debates about the scope and authority of logic have also focal to discussions of rationality The argument for relativism about logic is usually traced to the French anthropologist Lucien L√©vy Bruhl who claimed that tribal or primitive cultures did not subscribe to universal laws of logic such as the principles of non contradiction and identity and were in a pre logical stage of thinking L√©vy Bruhl In a posthumous publication L√©vy Bruhl renounced his earlier views finding them simplistic and rather crude L√©vy Bruhl but he remains the standard bearer for relativism about logic Peter Winch interpretation of the Azande material became the impetus for a new wave of arguments for relativism about logic Barry Barnes and David Bloor for instance have argued that different societies may have incompatible but internally coherent systems of logic because validity and rules of inference are defined by and hence are relative to the practices of a given community rather than a priori universal restrictions on all thought According to Bloor The Azande have the same psychology as us but radically different institutions If we relate logic to the psychology of reasoning we shall be inclined to say that they have the same logic if we relate logic more closely to the institutional framework of thought then we shall incline to the view that the two cultures have different logics Bloor Even the status of contradictions is at times seen as culturally relative and the Azande application of witchcraft in determining guilt is cited as an example The Azande according to Evans Prichard believe that it is possible to identify a witch by examining the contents of his intestine through the use of a poison oracle They also believe that Witchhood is inherited patrilineally Since the Azande clan members are related to each other through the male line it follows that if one person is shown to be a witch then all the members of his clan must also be witches Evans Pritchard tells us that although the Azande see the sense of this argument they do not accept the conclusion they seem to side step the contradiction in their belief system Relativistically inclined commentators have argued that the Azande both do and do not contradict themselves depending on or relative to the culture that is being taken as the vantage point Bloor and Jennings See Seidel for a sustained critique More recently Peng and Nisbett using experimental data have argued that Chinese and American students have different attitudes towards the Law of Non Contradiction The Chinese they claim are more willing to accept that conflicting views may be compatible and therefore are less disposed to recognize or condemn contradictions Peng Nisbett In his The Geography of Thought Nisbett has generalized his results to claim that Asian and European structures of thinking including perception and conceptualization differ significantly Nesbitt data as well as the claims by Barnes and Bloor are contributions to a long standing debate about the status of logic Their approach attempts to naturalize logic by tying it to the actual practices of the human subjects The relativistically inclined however argue that to think of logic as singular a priori and universal speaks of a philosophical prejudice and does not sit well with a naturalistic and scientific attitude As to the claim by Quine and Davidson that an allegedly illogical culture is in fact a misinterpreted or badly interpreted culture that if the speakers of a language seem to accept sentence of the form and not this is conclusive evidence that and and not in their language do not mean what these words mean in English Quine the relativistically inclined point out that reasoning in deviant ways is quite common and is not an impediment to understanding or translating others Stich They further argue that such diversity is better explained by the relativist claim that the correctness of the principles of reasoning is relative to their cultural background rather than by the absolutist approach that attributes wholesale error to alternative epistemic systems or to the members of other cultures Discussions of relativism about science gained currency with the publication of Thomas Kuhn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and the emergence of a historicist approach to question of change and progress in science Pronouncements such as In so far as their only recourse to the world is through what they see and do we may want to say that after a revolution scientists are responding to a different world Kuhn and The very ease and rapidity with which astronomers saw new things when looking at old objects with old instruments may make us wish to say that after Copernicus astronomers lived in a different world Kuhn were taken to suggest that not only standards of epistemic appraisal but even the data gathered by scientists were to a significant extent determined by governing paradigms and hence relative to them Although Kuhn stepped back from such radical relativism his views gave currency to relativistic interpretations of science Relativism about science is motivated by considerations arising from the methodology and history of science Baghramian As we saw in Quine has argued that Physical theories can be at odds with each other and yet compatible with all possible data even in the broadest possible sense In a word they can be logically incompatible and empirically equivalent Relativists about science have argued that only with the addition of auxiliary hypotheses could the scientist choose between various theories and that such auxiliary hypotheses are colored by socially and historically grounded norms as well as by personal and group interests Paul Feyerabend democratic relativism the view that different societies may look at the world in different ways and regard different things as acceptable and that we need to give equal voice to these differing perspectives is one instance of the use of the underdetermination thesis in support of relativism According to Feyerabend underdetermination ultimately demonstrates that for every statement theory point of view believed to be true with good reason there exist arguments showing a conflicting alternative to be at least as good or even better Larry Laudan usefully lists the ways underdetermination is used to motivate relativism or its proximate doctrines He says Lakatos and Feyerabend have taken the underdetermination of theories to justify the claim that the only difference between empirically successful and empirically unsuccessful theories lies in the talents and resources of their respective advocates with sufficient ingenuity more or less any theory can be made to look methodologically respectable Hesse and Bloor have claimed that underdetermination shows the necessity for bringing noncognitive social factors into play in explaining the theory choices of scientists on the grounds that methodological and evidential considerations alone are demonstrably insufficient to account for such choices Collins and several of his fellow sociologists of knowledge have asserted that underdetermination lends credence to the view that the world does little if anything to shape or constrain our beliefs about it Laudan Laudan even connects Derrida deconstructionism and the view that texts do not lend themselves to determinate readings with underdetermination ibid He also believes that an appropriately modest understanding of what underdetermination entails will distance it from relativism but most relativistically inclined advocates of underdetermination are not willing to follow Laudan advice to circumscribe its scope The key issue is that both the relativists and the anti relativists could agree that the totality of evidence available does not prove the truth of any given theory But the anti relativists responds to this fact of underdetermination by pointing out that the we have good reasons for embracing the best theory available and moreover that there are indeed objective facts about the world even if we are not in possession of them The relativist in contrast argues that there are many equally acceptable principles for accepting theories all on the basis of evidence available but such theories could result in very different verdicts They also argue that in the absence of any strong epistemic grounds for accepting the existence of absolute facts in any given domain we have no grounds other than some kind of metaphysical faith for thinking that there are such facts Relativism about science is also influenced by the related doctrine that all observations are theory laden Even anti relativists such as Karl Popper admit that the idea that observations are not in some way tinted by theoretical assumptions is na√Øve But some relativists about science offer a particularly extreme form of the doctrine of the widely accepted thesis of theory ladenness Feyerabend for instance goes so far as to argue that different systems of classification can result in perceptual objects that are not easily comparable Relativists about science also point to the prevalence of both synchronic and diachronic disagreement among scientists as a justification of their view Looking at the history of science Kuhn and his followers argued that Aristotelian physics presupposes a totally different conception of the universe compared to Newtonian physics the same is true of Einsteinian physics compared to its predecessors Moreover these differing conceptions may be incommensurable in the sense that they are not readily amenable to comparison or inter theoretical translation There are also strong and unresolved disagreements between scientists working contemporaneously The many different interpretations of quantum mechanics are a case in point Anti relativist philosophers of science are often willing to concede all three points above but insist that they do not singly or jointly justify the claim that scientific knowledge in any philosophically interesting sense is relative to its context of production The success of science both theoretical and applied indicates that progress does take place Fallibilism the view that all scientific claims are provisional and liable to fail they argue is sufficient for dealing with difficulties arising from considerations of underdetermination and theory ladenness of observations Relativism with its attendant denial that there could be objective and universal scientific truths or knowledge exacts too high a price for dealing with these allegedly troublesome features of the methodology and history of science Social constructionism is a particularly radical form of conceptual relativism with implications for our understanding of the methodology and subject matter of the sciences According to social constructionism nature as studied by scientists does not come carved at its joints to use Plato metaphor from Phaedrus Reality with its objects entities properties and categories is not simply out there to be discovered only by empirical investigation or observation rather it is constructed through a variety of norm governed socially sanctioned cognitive activities such as interpretation description manipulation of data etc Social constructionism has relativistic consequences insofar as it claims that different social forces lead to the construction of different worlds and that there is no neutral ground for adjudicating between them The Science Studies approach of Bruno Latour is a prime example of constructionism with relativistic consequences Latour and Woolgar have argued that so called scientific facts and the truths of science emerge out of social and conceptual practices and inevitably bear their imprints This is because the very idea of a mind independent reality open to scientific study or as they call it out there ness itself is the consequence of scientific work rather than the cause A crucial difference between scientific realists and constructionists is that whereas the realists see nature and society as the causes that explain the outcomes of scientific enquiry for the constructionists the activity of scientists and engineers and of all their human and non human allies is the cause of which various states of nature and societies are the consequence Callon Latour Scientific theories are also products of socially constituted practices They are contextually specific constructions which bear the mark of the situated contingency and interest structure of the process by which they are generated Knorr Cetina So called scientific facts and natural kinds the primary subjects of scientific investigation are at least in part the products of the contingent social and epistemic norms that define the very subject matter of science It may be argued that the view if taken literally entails a counter intuitive form of backward causation to the effect that for instance the scientific facts about dinosaur anatomy million years ago were caused in the century when a scientific consensus about dinosaur anatomy was formed see Boghossian But constructionism at least in its most extreme form accepts this consequence insisting that there are indeed no facts except for socially constructed ones created and modified at particular times and places courtesy of prevailing theoretical and conceptual frameworks Moral or ethical relativism is simultaneously the most influential and the most reviled of all relativistic positions Supporters see it as a harbinger of tolerance see open mindedness and anti authoritarianism Detractors think it undermines the very possibility of ethics and signals either confused thinking or moral turpitude Briefly stated moral relativism is the view that moral judgments beliefs about right and wrong good and bad not only vary greatly across time and contexts but that their correctness is dependent on or relative to individual or cultural perspectives and frameworks Moral subjectivism is the view that moral judgments are judgments about contingent and variable features of our moral sensibilities For the subjectivist to say that abortion is wrong is to say something like I disapprove of abortion or Around here we disapprove of abortion Once the content of the subjectivist claim is made explicit the truth or acceptability of a subjectivist moral judgment is no longer a relative matter Moral relativism proper on the other hand is the claim that facts about right and wrong vary with and are dependent on social and cultural background Understood in this way moral relativism could be seen as a sub division of cultural relativism Values may also be relativized to frameworks of assessment independent of specific cultures or social settings Moral relativism like most relativistic positions comes in various forms and strengths It is customary to distinguish between descriptive or empirical prescriptive or normative and meta ethical versions of moral relativism These views in turn are motivated by a number of empirical and philosophical considerations similar to those introduced in defense of cultural relativism The purported fact of ethical diversity the claim that there are no universally agreed moral norms or values conjoined with the intractability of the arguments about them are the core components of descriptive moral relativism The anti relativists counter argue that the observed diversity and lack of convergence in local norms can in fact be explained by some very general universal norms which combine with the different circumstances or false empirical beliefs of the different groups to entail different particular norms The objectivist thereby can accommodate diversity and lack of agreement at this higher level of generalization see Philippa Foot for this type of argument As in the case of cultural relativism the imperative of tolerance is often seen as a normative reason for adopting moral relativism Moral relativism it is argued leads to tolerance by making us not only more open minded but also alerting us to the limitations of our own views Edward Westermarck for instance in his early classic defense of relativism writes Could it be brought home to people that there is no absolute standard in morality they would perhaps be on the one hand more tolerant and on the other more critical in their judgments Westermarck Critics however point out that for the consistent relativist tolerance can be only a framework dependent virtue while Westermarck and others seem to recommend it as a universal desideratum A second problem with arguing for normative moral relativism on the grounds of tolerance is known as the Argumentum ad Nazium Relativists as this argument goes are not in a position to condemn even the most abhorrent of worldviews as they are forced to admit that every point of view is right relative to the perspective of its beholder Stace arguing against Westermarck relativism gives an early example of this type of criticism Certainly if we believe that any one moral standard is as good as any other we are likely to be more tolerant We shall tolerate widow burning human sacrifice cannibalism slavery the infliction of physical torture or any other of the thousand and one abominations which are or have been from time approved by moral code or another But this is not the kind of toleration that we want and I do not think its cultivation will prove an advantage to morality Stace More moderate forms of normative moral relativism positions that sometimes are characterized as moral pluralism have been defended by David Wong and David Velleman Moderate moral relativists endorse the idea of diversity and plurality of ethical values and accept that such values are justified according to differing local normative frameworks but they avoid a full blown anything goes relativism by maintaining that all such frameworks are ultimately answerable to conditions for human flourishing and other overarching universal constraints such as the value of accommodation Wong It should however be noted that while theses under the description of pluralism needn entail a commitment to relativism some formulations of relativism such as Boghossian include as an essential ingredient a pluralist clause Whether particular instances of moral pluralism entail moral relativism depends entirely on the details of relevant claim to pluralism Metaethical versions of moral relativism are often motivated by the thought that ethical positions unlike scientific beliefs are not apt for objective truth evaluation Strong realists about science such as Gilbert Harman have argued that the intractability of moral disagreements the absence of convergence in ethics as opposed to the natural sciences and mathematics point to fundamental differences between natural facts and ethical values Harman Thompson This is a metaethical rather than a descriptive or normative position because it is a theory about the nature of ethics or morality The ethical domain Harman argue is such that all relevant evaluations could be undertaken only in the context of social norms or personal preferences and commitments Values are not objective they are not part of the fabric of the universe Rather they always arise from some form of convention and agreement among people Therefore there can be no objective or externally justified ethical knowledge or judgment Harman In this sense metaethical relativism shares common concerns with non cognitivist approaches to ethics What distinguishes it however is the insistence on the part of metaethical relativists that moral judgments contain an implicit relativization to the speaker moral outlook Dreier It is possible to talk about the truth or falsity of a moral judgment but only in the context of pre existing standards or value systems For instance we can ask questions about just actions or judgments in the context of standards of justice prevalent in a society at a given time but questions about the objective standing of these standards do not make sense For further discussion of moral relativism see the separate entry on this topic What has become known as New Moral Relativism will be discussed below There is a recent version of relativism according to which some of the views considered so far for instance Harman variety of moral relativism will be regarded varieties of contextualism as opposed to bona fide relativism This recent version sufficiently distinct from the relativisms so far considered that it is deserving of attention in its own right we are calling New Relativism a variety of relativism that has arisen out of work in the philosophy of language in the analytic tradition and for which the leading proponents have included Max K√∂lbel Peter Lasersohn Crispin Wright and in particular John MacFarlane In this section we aim to outline several features that individuate New Relativism ii consider in turn motivations for and objections to several prominent strands of it and finally iii conclude with some philosophical problems that face New Relativism more generally It is a commonplace that the truth value of an utterance can depend on the context in which it is uttered If you say I happy and I say the same sentence your utterance may be true and mine false In such cases the context of utterance plays a role in determining which proposition the sentence expresses This can happen even when the sentence does not contain an overtly indexical expression Thus Harman and Dreier hold that a statement of the form A is wrong is roughly equivalent to A is wrong according to the moral system I accept So two utterances of say Torture is wrong can differ in truth value if they are uttered by speakers who accept very different moral systems Contextualists about for instance moral aesthetic and epistemic discourse will view moral aesthetic and epistemic expressions likewise as indexical expressions but as we ll see with some difficulty explaining apparent genuine disagreement in these areas of discourse On this point New Relativists claim an important advantage over contextualists New relativism by contrast with contextualism aims to achieve this advantage via a much less familiar form of context dependence Truth relativism with respect to utterances in area of discourse is the claim that following MacFarlane notable version of the view the truth of utterance depends in part on a context of assessment that is and in short what asserts gets a truth value according to the truth relativist semantics only once the standard of the assessor is specified Independent of the specification of such a standard assertion lacks a truth value much as by comparison indexical expressions such as The barn is nearby do not get a truth value independent of contextual facts about the context of use the context in which the utterance is made And as a further point of clarification here while the contextualist can no less than the relativist recognize a standards or judge parameter for the contextualist its value will be supplied by the context of use whereas the relativist takes it to be supplied completely independently of the context of use by the context of evaluation or as MacFarlane calls it the context of assessment To see how this view is claimed to offer a satisfying take on disagreement consider a simple example concerning predicates of personal taste A utters Pretzels are tasty and utters Pretzels are not tasty While the semantic invariantist for whom the truth value of taste predications is in no way context sensitive will insist that the above exchange constitutes a genuine disagreement about whether pretzels are tasty and that at least one party is wrong contextualists and truth relativists have the prima facie advantageous resources to avoid the result that at least one party to the apparent disagreement has made a mistake The contextualist claims that the truth evaluable content expressed by A utterance encodes A standards cf non indexical contextualism Thus in this apparent disagreement the proposition expressed by A is Pretzels are tasty relative to my A standards while expresses the proposition Pretzels are not tasty relative to my standards This maneuver avoids the result that at least one of the two parties has uttered something false but as the new relativist points out this result comes at the price of being unable to offer a clear explanation of our intuition that there is some uniform content about which A and disagree The new relativist on the other hand claims to be able to preserve both the apparent subjectivity of taste discourse and and unlike the contextualist our intuition that exchanges of the form mentioned constitute genuine disagreements They do this by first insisting unlike the contextualist that there is a single truth evaluable proposition which A affirms and denies In the case where A says Pretzels are tasty and denies this there is a uniform content that is affirmed by A utterance and denied by namely the proposition that pretzels are tasty period So we have a genuine disagreement Unlike the truth absolutist however the new relativist will add that the disagreement is faultless because the proposition affirmed in A utterance has a truth value only relative to a judge or standards parameter and in this case A standards when A is the assessor standards when is the assessor Hence the truth relativist about predicates of personal taste will by insisting that the truth of Pretzels are tasty depends on the context of assessment allow a single proposition to be at the same time ii false relative to the context of assessment where standards of taste are operative New Relativist views which endorse truth relativism locally for some domain of discourse stand in opposition to the more traditional view of propositional content what Cappelen Hawthorne call The Simple View according to which propositions bear truth and falsity as monadic properties cf however MacFarlane for some resistance to Cappelen Hawthorne claim that this simple characterization should be regarded as the received view A key source of philosophical motivation for relativizing truth in the fashion of New Relativism traces to Lewis and Kaplan foundational work in semantics according to which sentence truth is to be understood as relative to a circumstance of evaluation that includes world time and location New Relativists inherit the formal apparatus of Lewis and Kaplan and add another parameter but their reasons for doing so are quite different from the reasons that motivated the framework in the first place While Lewis and Kaplan reasons for proliferating parameters were primarily based on considerations to do with intensional operators the more contemporary reasons for adding a judge or standard parameter are often to do with respecting for instance disagreement data For further discussion here see K√∂lbel Note that old style contextualism can also be stated in Kaplan framework it involves variation in content with respect to the context of utterance rather than in truth value with respect to the circumstance of evaluation Kaplan view specifically was that the need for particular parameters in the circumstance of evaluation was a function of the non specificity of certain propositional contents with respect to world time and location see Kaplan analysis of indexicals On Kaplan view A circumstance will usually include a possible state or history of the world a time and perhaps other features as well The amount of information we require from a circumstance is linked to the degree of specificity of contents and thus to the kinds of operators in the language John MacFarlane a leading contemporary relativist writes Taking this line of thought a little farther the relativist might envision contents that are sense of humor neutral or standard of taste neutral or epistemic state neutral and circumstances of evaluation that include parameters for a sense of humor a standard of taste or an epistemic state This move would open up room for the truth value of a proposition to vary with these subjective factors in much the same way that it varies with the world of evaluation MacFarlane Similarly Cappelen and Hawthorne write Contemporary analytic relativists reason as follows Lewis and Kaplan have shown that we need to relativize truth to triples of world time location But having already started down this road why not exploit these strategies further In particular by adding new and exotic parameters into the circumstances of evaluation we can allow the contents of thought and talk to be non specific in Kaplan sense along dimensions other than world time and location edited A question on which New Relativists are divided however is what contents are non specific along dimensions other than world time and location It is with respect to this general question that different families of New Relativism are generated The taxonomy we offer is that a view falls within the category of New Relativism if and only if the view endorses a truth relativist semantics as previously outlined for utterance tokens in some domain of discourse such as discourse about predicates of personal taste Lasersohn K√∂lbel epistemic modals Egan Egan Hawthorne Weatherson MacFarlane Stephenson future contingents MacFarlane indicative conditionals Weatherson Kolodny MacFarlane gradable adjectives Richard deontic modals Kolodny MacFarlane and MacFarlane ch and knowledge attributions Richard MacFarlane The motivations for truth relativism in each of these domains include various considerations unique to those domains We consider some of the arguments for New Relativism in four of these domains in the following sections One area of discourse that has been particularly fertile ground for New Relativism is discourse that concerns predicates of personal taste tasty and fun Take a case where Mary says The chili is tasty and John says The chili is not tasty Lasersohn argues much as K√∂lbel does that only the truth relativist can make sense of the nature of John and Mary disagreement It is a genuine disagreement One affirms what the other denies And yet neither is wrong Lasersohn argues that there is an elegant way to make sense of the idea that John and Mary are both in some sense right even though John asserts the negation of what is expressed by Mary What Lasersohn suggests more formally is the introduction of a judge parameter Instead of treating the content of a sentence as a set of time world pairs we should treat it as a set of time world individual triples We assume that the content will provide an individual to be used in evaluating the sentences for truth and falsity just as it provides a time and world Lasersohn Lasersohn adds that in order to maintain an authentically subjective assignment of truth values to sentences containing predicates of personal taste we must allow that the objective facts of the situation of utterance do not uniquely determine a judge But who is the judge Typically it is us and when it is the evaluation is from what Lasersohn calls an autocentric perspective Importantly Lasersohn allows that in certain circumstances we take an exocentric perspective when assessing predicates of personal taste assessing these sentences for truth relative to contexts in which someone other than ourselves is specified as the judge cf Come on it ll be fun Is this fun cf Stanley for a response to Lasersohn program K√∂lbel faultless disagreement argument for relativism about predicates of personal taste features a proof that there is no faultless disagreement followed by a demonstration that the proof is indefensible The proof proceeds from two premises an equivalence schema and an apparent truism about mistakes ES and generate the conclusion that there is no faultless disagreement through the following proof see also Wright But because K√∂lbel takes to be implausible in what K√∂lbel takes to be discretionary non objective as K√∂lbel sees it areas of discourse he contends that we should introduce a relativized version of to avoid the conclusion that at least one party has made a mistake It is a mistake to believe a discretionary proposition that is not true as evaluated from one own perspective K√∂lbel claims further that for reasons of uniformity we should relativize truth of all propositions across the board and he accordingly endorses the following version of truth relativism TR It is a mistake to believe a proposition that is not true in one own perspective K√∂lbel thinks that this position allows the possibility of maintaining that faultless disagreement is impossible in some non discretionary objective areas and this will depend on the relation of perspective possession but see also Boghossian for the contrary view An implication of the position is that K√∂lbel view will allow assertions of the form Pretzels are not tasty though John believes they are And yet John is not mistaken For other discussions of faultless disagreement see Richard MacFarlane ch There is a version of moral relativism K√∂lbel that falls squarely within the New Relativist tradition We can think of this relativism simply as a generalization of the position just discussed that treats moral terms right good as assessment sensitive along with predicates of personal taste Such an extension faces problems analogous to those faced by truth relativists about predicates of personal taste cf Beebe for a helpful discussion of truth relativist semantics versus varieties of contextualist competitors A broader kind of problem for this semantic thesis as well as to moral relativists more generally raised by Coliva and Moruzzi is that it succumbs to the progress argument an argument that famously challenges in particular cultural relativists as well as indexical contextualists about moral judgments by insisting that moral progress is both evident and not something the relativist can countenance Rachels A third and particularly important kind of worry addressed by Capps Lynch and Massey involves explaining the source and nature of moral relativity on a truth relativist framework Specifically they claim that we ought to have some account of why it is that truth in the moral domain is such that it varies with a parameter set by the context of assessment Capps Lynch Massey Epistemic modality claims of the form might be is another particularly fertile ground for New Relativists A key reason for this is the dialectical force of Eavesdropper Arguments which attempt to show the perils of contextualist treatments of utterances containing epistemic modals Another prominent argument concerns metasemantic complexity We will examine both of these argument strategies But first let distinguish epistemic modality from metaphysical modality To say that is metaphysically possible is to say that might have been the case in the sense that in some possible world is true To say that is epistemically possible is by contrast to say that might be the case or that is the case for all we know see the entry on Varieties of Modality A canonical example of a statement expressing an epistemic modal is the claim A might be The truth of claims of the form A might be will depend on whether is an epistemic possibility for some individual or group which is to say that must not be ruled out by what some individual or group knows But which individual or group This is not always clear As Egan and Weatherson remark statements of epistemic possibility in plain English do not make any explicit reference to such a person group evidence set or information state One of the key issues confronting a semanticist attempting to theorize about epistemic modals is what to do about this lack of reference Eavesdropper style cases highlight the difficulty of determining exactly which individual or group body of information is relevant to the truth of claims of epistemic possibility and are taken by defenders of truth relativism about epistemic modals to motivate their position A variety of different eavesdropper cases have been given by different proponents and attempted refuters of truth relativism about epistemic modals in the literature For ease of exposition we will use an especially simple version of the case from Hawthorne slightly amended EAVESDROPPER Sandra is on the way to the grocery store I hear her say Susan might be at the store I could run into her No party to the conversation that I am listening in on knows that Susan is on vacation But I know that she is Despite the fact that it is compatible with what the conversants know that Susan is in the store and that the speaker will run into her I am inclined to judge the speaker Sandra modal judgments to be incorrect Hawthorne Egan Egan Hawthorne and Weatherson and MacFarlane share a similar set of diagnoses here it seems that while Sandra and I disagree about the truth value of Sandra statement neither she nor I have made a mistake ii the contextualist can explain this iii the truth relativist can Why can the contextualist explain this As noted the truth of claims expressing epistemic modals must depend on what some individual or group knows But in these cases the context of use does not pick out a single such individual or group After all if it did then either Sandra or I would be wrong but it seems that neither of us is That the context of use does not uniquely pick out one relevant body of knowledge for determining the truth of epistemic modal statements is not as MacFarlane notes something that can be accommodated by the framework of contextualism which requires that the relevant body of knowledge be determined by features of the context of use MacFarlane Additionally as Egan and Weatherson suggest any contextualist account of the semantics of epistemic modals that could handle eavesdropper style cases in a principled way would be hideously complicated This motivates a metasemantic argument against contextualism and a corresponding argument for relativism if contextualism about epistemic modals is correct then the semantics for epistemic modals will be hideously complicated the semantics is not hideously complicated on the truth relativist proposal therefore ceteris paribus truth relativism for epistemic modals is more plausible than contextualism However Glanzberg notably denies that metasemantic complexity in this case must be problematic How can the relativist accommodate eavesdropper cases MacFarlane articulates the relativist solution Sandra and I disagree about the truth value of a single proposition the proposition that Susan might be at the store This proposition even when fully articulated makes no reference to any particular body of knowledge But such propositions cannot be true or false simpliciter They are true only relative to a context of assessment that includes a body of knowledge In this case the proposition is true relative to a context of assessment where what Sandra knows is operative a context in which Sandra is the evaluator and false relative to a context of assessment where what I know is operative because I am the evaluator Thus both disagreement and faultlessness are preserved cf Ross Schroeder for criticism Along with MacFarlane Egan and Stephenson have also offered positive defenses of truth relativism about epistemic modals their defenses share MacFarlane view that propositions expressing epistemic modals are non specific along dimensions that include the body of information possessed by a judge or assessor Propositions termed future contingents are about the future and their truth values are not settled by the state of the world in the past or present see entry on Future Contingents and MacFarlane ch In a deterministic world there are no future contingent statements in this sense But in an indeterministic world statements partly about the future will often satisfy these conditions Consider Aristotle oft cited example the proposition There will be a sea battle tomorrow uttered at Contrast now two intuitions the determinacy intuition that utterances that turned out true were true at the time of utterance and the indeterminacy intuition that at the time of the utterance multiple histories are possible including one where there was a sea battle and the proposition is true and one where there was not and the proposition is false The indeterminacy intuition leads us to think the truth value of future contingents is indeterminate at the time of utterance and either true or false at a later time cf MacFarlane Carter John MacFarlane thinks that both the indeterminacy intuition and the determinacy intuition should be taken at face value and that the only way to account for the semantics of future contingents is to allow the truth of future contingent statements to be as he puts it doubly relativized to both the context of utterance and the context of assessment When we evaluate a single token utterance of There will be a sea battle tomorrow produced on say Monday this counts as neither true nor false when the context of assessment is the context in which the utterance is being made as multiple possible histories are open at this point However the very same statement will have a determinate truth value relative to the context of assessment of the following day So we can have faultless transtemporal disagreement about the truth value of a single utterance MacFarlane cf Carter MacFarlane argues that know is sensitive to the epistemic standards at play in the context of assessment that is the extension of know varies with the context of assessment Much as the relativist about future contingents aimed to accommodate both the determinacy and indeterminacy intuitions the relativist about knowledge attributions can be viewed as offering an attempted synthesis between the contextualist and both sensitive and insensitive varieties of invariantist see entry on Epistemic Contextualism As MacFarlane puts it Invariantism is right that there is a single knowledge relation and that the accuracy of knowledge ascriptions does not depend on which epistemic standard is relevant at the context of use But contextualism is right that the accuracy of such ascriptions depends somehow on contextually relevant standards Relativism seeks to synthesize these insights into a more satisfactory picture To apply this view suppose George says Bill knows that his car is in the driveway while Barry says Bill doesn know that his car is in the driveway According to the relativist the assessment of the truth values of Bill and Barry statements depends also on the specification of some epistemic standard For the truth relativist the standard will be the operative standard in the context of assessment George utterance may be true and Barry false relative to a context of assessment in which ordinary low standards are in place whereas Barry may be true and George false relative to a context of assessment in which high Cartesian standards are in place See Stanley ch for a detailed criticism of this position though see also MacFarlane for a reply See also Richard for another version of truth relativism for knowledge attributions In MacFarlane more recent defense of a truth relativist semantics for knows the context of assessment is taken to fix which alternatives count as relevant See however Carter for an argument that MacFarlane more recent view generates counterintuitive results in cases of environmental epistemic luck barn fa√ßade style cases and normative defeaters We turn now to two general arguments against New Relativism in all its forms The first is an argument from assertion the second an argument from simplicity Two assertion related objections to New Relativism arise from work by Gareth Evans and Robert Stalnaker respectively Greenough concisely captures Evans challenge to truth relativism on assertoric grounds as follows Any legitimate answer to this question will generate a once and for all answer The relativist must plausibly take issue with or or both For an attempt to meet Evans challenge MacFarlane has defended a way to effectively reject via what Marques has called a meet the challenge norm of assertion cf MacFarlane though see also his ch according to which la Brandom in asserting one undertakes a commitment to either defending or giving up if the challenge cannot be met satisfactorily see K√∂lbel for some other discussions of this objection A related assertion based challenge to truth relativism emerges by appeal to Stalnaker belief transfer model of assertion cf The idea here is to appeal to a plausible view of the purpose of assertion to transfer beliefs from assertor to members of her audience Egan and then to object that what is asserted according to the truth relativist cannot play this characteristic role specifically this will be because for the truth relativist the asserted contents are liable to be true relative to the speaker but false relative to the audience For instance Sam hardly on the truth relativist program seems to transfer to Dean his belief Apples are tasty which is true by asserting this to Dean when what Dean comes to believe Apples are tasty is something on the assumption that Dean doesn like apples that will be false Thus and more generally it not clear what exactly could be said to be transferred and a fortiori asserted See Egan for an attempt to reconcile truth relativism about epistemic modals with Stalnaker belief transfer model of assertion Cappelen and Hawthorne assess the merits of New Relativism as it stands to challenge what they take to be the received view of the objects of thought and talk Simplicity the core tenets of which are There are propositions and they instantiate the fundamental monadic properties of truth simpliciter and falsity simpliciter The semantic values of declarative sentences relative to contexts of utterance are propositions Propositions are unsurprisingly the objects of propositional attitudes such as belief hope wish doubt Propositions are the objects of illocutionary acts they are what we assert and deny Propositions are the objects of agreement and disagreement Cappelen Hawthorne Cappelen and Hawthorne understand New Relativism what they call analytic relativism as a direct challenge to and that if this challenge were successful it would consequently bring down the more general picture they call simplicity Accordingly Cappelen and Hawthorne central objective is to show that truth relativist arguments aimed at undermining are ultimately unsuccessful more specifically their broad strategy is to insist that the arguments adduced in favor of truth relativism when thoroughly understood constitute a presumptive case for contextualism in the domains where relativism was defended and in particularly in the domain of predicates of personal taste Relativism comes in a plethora of forms that are themselves grounded in disparate philosophical motivations There is no such thing as Relativism simpliciter and no single argument that would establish or refute every relativistic position that has been proposed Despite this diversity however there are commonalities and family resemblances that justify the use of the label relativism for the various views we have discussed Relativism remains a hotly disputed topic still surviving various attempts to eliminate it from philosophical discourse What is most surprising however is the recent popularity of some versions of the doctrine in at least some circles of analytic philosophy Aristotle

peace and opposition to war Our ordinary language allows a diverse set of beliefs and commitments to be held together under the general rubric of pacifism This article will explain the family resemblance among the variety of pacifisms It will locate pacifism within deontological and consequentialist approaches to ethics And it will consider and reply to objections to pacifism The word pacifism is derived from the word pacific which means peace making Latin paci from pax meaning peace and ficus meaning making Pacifism in the West appears to begin with Christianity Perhaps the most famous use of the word pacifism is found in the Sermon on the Mount Matthew where Jesus claims that the peacemakers are blessed In this passage the Greek word eirenopoios is translated into Latin as pacifici which means those who work for peace The Greek eirenopoios is derived from the Greek eir√™n√™ peace in conjunction with poiesis to make Philosophical discussions of pacifism have clarified the concept by distinguishing the more general commitment to nonviolence from a narrower anti war position Pacifism is further defined through its dialectical relation to the idea of justified violence that is found in the Western just war tradition with many locating pacifism on a continuum for assessing the morality of war that includes realism just war theory and pacifism Indeed there is an ongoing debate about the proper relation between just war theory and pacifism that focuses on the question of whether the just war theory begins with a pacifist presumption against war Some authors May for example have used the just war theory to derive a version of pacifism described as contingent pacifism or just war pacifism Some have tried to distinguish pacific ism from pacifism where pacific ism is a commitment to peace and peacefulness that is not strictly opposed to war while pacifism is a more principled or absolute rejection of violence But this distinction is not widely accepted although Dower has employed it recently William James used the term pacific ism in to describe his rejection of militarism The shorter term pacifism has become more common in English usage during the Century to describe a variety of views that are critical of war Generally pacifism is thought to be a principled rejection of war and killing Oddly enough the term pacifism has occasionally been used to describe a pragmatic commitment to using war to create peace Thus some who called themselves pacifists for example during the First World War supported war as a suitable means toward peace Richard Nixon once called himself a pacifist even as he continued to support the Vietnam War This perverse use of pacifism is connected to the way a term like pacification can be employed in military usage to describe a violent process of suppressing violence as when an enemy territory is pacified by killing or disabling the enemy While George Orwell and others have complained about such euphemistic descriptions of violence the just war tradition does hold that war can be a suitable means to bring about peace Despite these complications pacifism generally connotes a commitment to making peace that rejects violent means for obtaining this end One reason to reject violent means is the fact that might does not make right While violence can destroy an enemy victory does not amount to justification Pacifism as it is understood in ordinary discourse today includes a variety of commitments on a continuum from an absolute adherence to nonviolence in all actions to a more focused or minimal sort of anti warism In contrast to the just war tradition pacifism rejects war as an acceptable means for obtaining peace Pacifists will often refuse to serve in the military And some refuse to support political and social systems that promote war by for example withholding their taxes Pacifism can be used to describe a commitment to nonviolence in one personal life that might include the attempt to cultivate pacific virtues such as tolerance patience mercy forgiveness and love It might also be extended to include nonviolence toward all sentient beings and thus result in a commitment to vegetarianism and what Albert Schweitzer called reverence for life And pacifism can be connected to a larger project of spiritual transformation as in Gandhi commitment to ahimsa or nonviolence Pacifism is the broad commitment to making peace The idea is complicated by the fact that peace is a family resemblance term there are many varieties of peace Peace is easiest to define dialectically as the opposite of war or violence Pacifism has thus been described simply as anti warism or as commitment to nonviolence One conceptual difficulty here is that when peace is defined negatively pacifism appears as a reactionary response to war and violence Discussions of peace thus often employ negative terms and creative neologisms to express the concept of peace nonviolence nonwar nonkilling nonconflict or nonwar Peace advocates will however insist that peace should be understood as a primary concept connected to cooperation harmony and positive human relations and that it is a mistake to understand peace in merely negative terms see Fox At any rate peace scholarship has long emphasized the distinction between negative peace and positive peace negative peace is the absence of violence or war while positive peace encompasses cooperative tranquil and harmonious relations and the broader concerns of human flourishing and integration see Galtung When pacifism is defined as anti warism we encounter the difficulty of defining war War is usually thought of as violence between states or more broadly speaking political communities But the term war can also be applied to violent conflicts among individuals as in Hobbes idea that the state of nature is a state of war Similarly although peace is usually thought of as a political condition of amicable relations between states terms like peace or peaceful can also be used to describe a relation between individuals or even a person state of mind If pacifism is defined as a commitment to nonviolence we encounter the same problem of definition Violence usually has a normative value and is defined as something like an unjustified injury or harm But it is possible to speak of justified violence as in the just war ideal so not all violence is unjustified The concept of violence can also be extended metaphorically and used as an adjective violent to mean something like unbridled uncontrolled rough or intense Thus we speak of violent storms or violent emotions A commitment to nonviolence is at least a commitment to avoiding unjustified intentional injury Pacifists will tend to think that most intentionally caused harms are unjustifiable But the ideal of nonviolence might be extended to include the idea of controlling rough and intense emotions In his essay Journey to Nonviolence for example Martin Luther King Jr claimed that a commitment to nonviolence required overcoming the internal violence of hatred and anger by cultivating love and compassion King There are a variety of possibilities for thinking about the nature of peace and thus for understanding what pacifism aims at creating Peace can result from submission to power and war can end with unconditional surrender Rousseau maligned this sort of peace by calling it the peace of Ulysses and his comrades imprisoned in the cave of the Cyclops and waiting their turn to be devoured Rousseau We might claim that absolute rule and absolute submission produce a sort of peace But this is peace conjoined with injustice So it is clear that the sort of peace that is worth pursuing is peace that is also linked to justice The idea of justice is at the heart of the just war tradition which claims that we are entitled to fight back against injustice As Patrick Henry asked in his famous Give me Liberty or Give me Death Speech Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery One might claim that the peace of the Cyclops cave is not peace at all but a state of war Most pacifists will claim that the peace of slavery is not what they have in mind Rather for the majority of pacifists pacifism is not simply acquiescing passively to evil pacifism is not passive ism Rather pacifism involves actively but nonviolently resisting evil Nonetheless some pacifists such as Tolstoy do advocate nonresistance Nonresistant pacifists in the Christian tradition often base the idea of submitting to evil on Jesus ideas as expressed in the Sermon on the Mount Do not resist one who is evil and love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you Matthew and Luke Some Christian martyrs take this ideal seriously and look to Jesus life and execution as a model of pacific virtue The dialectical definition of peace as the absence of war can encompass the idea of the armed peace of the Cold War Peace as the absence of war may be a mere modus vivendi in which armed opponents refrain from attacking one another out of fear This sort of peace is the peace of a truce or stalemate While it is true that in such conditions there is no overt damage done the opponents have not been reconciled and hostile intentions have not been eliminated Some may claim that the best we can do to make peace is to reach a state of detente that is made possible by mutual deterrent force Related to this is what might be called following Raymond Aron peace by impotence or peace by exhaustion Aron ff In this sort of peace the antagonistic parties are simply no longer willing to fight Hostile intentions may persist but the will to fight can no longer be actualized Kant rejected this sort of peace claiming that peace means an end to all hostilities Kant This is why Kant maintains that the first principle of perpetual peace is that states should not make secret reservation of the material for future war Those who call themselves pacifists will usually agree with Kant that a mere modus vivendi produced by impotence or exhaustion is not actually peace since hostile intent remains And pacifists will argue that the peace of deterrence and detente are not really peace either because they are the result of an increase in armaments and the threat of escalated violence Opposed to peace as modus vivendi is what Aron calls peace by satisfaction Aron ff This is a peace that results from a lack of grievances and hostility In the history of the West this sort of peace is often linked to what Augustine called the tranquility of order Augustine Book Chapter In recent Western thought this idea often follows Kant in claiming that liberal democracy is the key to such a tranquil order Francis Fukuyama Hegelian idea about the end of history for example hoped that the end of the Cold War would bring about the end of war in general as liberal democracy spread Similarly Michael Doyle has claimed that democracies do not go to war with one another John Rawls has explained the stability of well ordered democratic states as follows There is true peace among them because all societies are satisfied with the status quo for the right reasons Rawls More recently this idea about the stabilizing and peace making power of democracy has influenced neo conservative ideas in foreign policy where the hope is that peace will occur as democracy is spread The idea that peace is founded in a just political order is connected to the ideas of the just war tradition Defenders of the just war tradition from Augustine to Walzer argue that occasionally it is necessary to make war in order to establish such a tranquil and just social condition More recent defenders of the just war idea such as Luban Lucas and Teson have argued that interventionist wars should be fought in order to create stable conditions by defending human rights Pacifists will disagree with those who claim that wars should be fought in pursuit of the ideal of a just and stable social order Proponents of humanitarian intervention maintain that war is a suitable means for attaining the goal of respect for human rights and satisfaction of human needs but pacifists will argue that only nonviolent means are coherent with the these intended ends Positive definitions of peace go beyond merely dialectical definitions of peace as the opposite of war and instead focus on peace as a state of rest wholeness or completion The peace of a just and tranquil order points toward something like a condition of wholeness in which there is solidarity mutual respect and satisfaction of needs In this vision of peace there is genuine community and human flourishing One central concern from the standpoint of positive peace is the work of peace education as well as work on nonviolent conflict resolution and mediation see Fitz Gibbon Related concerns point toward the importance of justice with a special focus on restorative justice and community building The positive ideal of peace can point beyond the merely political realm and aim toward spiritual transformation In Christian contexts this is related to the peace of God that surpasses all understanding as in Philippians In Buddhism this is related to the idea propounded by Thich Nhat Hanh of being peace that is connected to Buddhist practice The Dalai Lama claims that peace is more than the absence of war and he connects his vision of world peace to peacefulness as a state of mind peace is a state of tranquility founded on the deep sense of security that arises from mutual understanding tolerance of others point of view and respect for their rights Dalai Lama This is closely related to the ideal of social stability but the Dalai Lama also connects it to the deeper process of personal transformation Building upon these ideas Michael Fox has described peace as a way of life a peaceful way of life will be such as to incorporate nonviolence toward oneself and others and will be guided by cooperation mutual respect creative problem solving negotiation of differences and caring concern or compassion Fox Positive peace can be best understood from the tradition of virtue ethics where peacefulness is understood as a virtue that is connected to other virtues such as modesty tolerance and mercy It is important to note that peace is not mere quietism and the passivity of meditation or contemplation Jay McDaniel has recently argued in favor of a notion of creative peace in which there is tension and activity as individuals and cultures must learn to listen to and interact with one another Varieties of Pacifism Pacifism includes a wide variety of ideas that can be gathered under the general idea that war and violence are morally wrong This variety can be organized in several ways according to various interrelated conceptual distinctions absolute and contingent pacifism maximal and minimal pacifism universal vs particular pacifism These distinctions overlap as we shall see here This distinction organizes different answers to the question of how obligated we are to reject violence and war Absolute pacifism is understood as a maximal and universal rejection of violence and war Absolutism in ethics or moral absolutism holds that moral principles are eternal and unchanging and that they admit no exceptions So absolute pacifism holds that war and violence are always wrong One recent proponent of a version of absolute pacifism is Michael Allen Fox Fox argues that war is inconsistent with morality and with human well being He concludes by asserting a very strong form of pacifism and admits that this results in some uncomfortable conclusions such as that even military action aimed at protecting people against acute and systematic human rights violations cannot be justified Fox Fox explains that pacifism results in a difficult dilemma that is reminiscent of the question of whether two wrongs can make a right Fox asks Should immoral actions be used to stop other perhaps gravely more immoral actions Fox He answers No and maintains that this shows us that we have to work to find ways to move beyond our reliance on war as the solution to social and political problems Non absolute pacifism may be called contingent pacifism While absolute pacifism admits no exceptions to the rejection of war and violence contingent pacifism is usually understood as a principled rejection of a particular war A different version of contingent pacifism can also be understood to hold that pacifism is only an obligation for a particular group of individuals and not for everyone Contingent pacifism can also be a principled rejection of a particular military system or set of military policies Contingent pacifists may accept the permissibility or even necessity of war in some circumstances and reject it in others while absolute pacifists will always and everywhere reject war and violence Absolute pacifism is often connected with a religious standpoint in which nonviolence is seen as a religious commandment Thomas Merton explains that Gandhi and most other absolute pacifists have a larger metaphysical view as Gandhi saw the fully consistent practice of nonviolence demands a solid metaphysical basis both in being and in God Merton In the West absolute pacifism is often derived from the Christian ideal of nonresistance to evil as required by Jesus pronouncements about nonresistance in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew or the Sermon on the Plain in Luke In Indian traditions it is grounded in the commitment to ahimsa or nonviolence that is derived from a larger metaphysical picture which emphasizes karmic interdependence ascetic self abnegation and compassion The religious foundation of absolute pacifism is often tied to the idea that there is merit in suffering violence without retaliating As Martin Luther King Jr puts this unearned suffering is redemptive King Absolute pacifism is an ideal Some versions of absolute pacifism go so far as to abjure the idea of personal self defense Other absolute pacifists may allow for personal self defense while rejecting the impersonal and political violence of war Almost every defender of absolute pacifism recognizes the difficulty of attaining to the absolute idea Gandhi writes the following in his autobiography Man cannot for a moment live without consciously or unconsciously committing outward himsa violence A votary of ahimsa nonviolence therefore remains true to this faith if the spring of all his actions is compassion if he shuns to the best of his ability the destruction of the tiniest creature tries to save it and thus incessantly strives to be free from the deadly coil of himsa He will be constantly growing in self restraint and compassion but he can never become entirely free from outward himsa Gandhi The absolute ideal is nearly impossible to achieve because we must harm other beings in order to survive we must kill in order to eat And the world often presents us with difficult kill or be killed choices as in the question of self defense or war Absolute pacifists may hold that it is better to be killed than to kill But such a choice may be impossible for many of us to make Pacifists will often argue that this way of describing a situation as one where the choice is kill or be killed usually presents us with a false dilemma often there are other nonviolent alternatives to either killing or being killed But when presented with such a stark choice absolute pacifism may require self sacrifice Contingent or conditional pacifism qualifies such an uncompromising condemnation of violence and warfare Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell for example were both supporters of the war against Nazi Germany despite the fact that each considered himself to be a pacifist Russell identified his position as what he called relative political pacifism Russell Russell uses the word relative to describe the contingent nature of the commitment to peace one commitment to pacifism depends upon or is relative to the nature of the war Relative pacifism means for Russell that very few wars are worth fighting and that the evils of war are almost always greater than they seem to excited populations at the moment when war breaks out Russell Russell calls his position political because his emphasis is on war and political institutions not on a personal commitment to nonviolence Along these lines David Cortright has recently described what he calls realistic pacifism Cortright claims that in the realm of nuclear war pacifism is absolute But in other sorts of conflict pacifism is conditional and pragmatic and predicated on a presumption against armed violence but it acknowledges that the use of force constrained by rigorous ethical standards may be necessary at times for self defense and the protection of the innocent Cortright Such an idea is clearly related to just war theory Indeed some authors such as Larry May have derived contingent pacifism from just war thinking There are several varieties of contingent pacifism First pacifism may not be required of all moral agents Thus pacifism may only be required for members of particular professions Pacifism is often thought to be a professional obligation of certain religious vocations But such a vocation may be thought of as a choice of conscience that is not universally required In this version of contingent pacifism the prohibition against violence only applies to those who take a vow or make a pledge to renounce violence and war Within this two tiered approach the vow of peacefulness might be considered as a sort of supererogatory ideal that is not required of others But it is also possible for the two tier approach to contain an implicit condemnation of those who do not take up the higher calling of pacifism A second sort of contingent pacifism holds that if a particular war or military policy is prudentially unwise it should be resisted Such prudential pacifism is based upon cost benefit analyses focused on the facts of particular conflicts A more principled sort of prudential pacifism can be based upon the general claim that war usually causes more harm than good A third sort of contingent pacifism will appeal to the just war theory and claim that a given war is unjust according to this theory As John Rawls says of what he calls contingent pacifism the possibility of a just war is conceded but not under present circumstances Rawls This idea is closely related to just war pacifism as developed in the last couple of decades by critics of the just war tradition just war pacifism maintains that modern wars are not fought according to the standards of the just war theory because for example they make use of aerial bombardment and other means that do not adequately discriminate between combatants and noncombatants Such a claim may result in a nearly absolute proscription against war under present circumstances And it may contain an absolute prohibition against certain sorts of war such as nuclear war Most so called just war pacifists are contingent pacifists in this sense they object to the way modern wars are fought With the just war theory in mind contingent pacifism may focus either on the basis for war as in the just war idea of jus ad bellum on the way that the war is being fought as in the just war idea of jus in bello or on the expected outcome of the war as in the idea of jus post bellum With regard to jus ad bellum contingent pacifists may reject the legitimacy of the authority who is fighting they may claim that war is not being fought as a last resort or they may deny that the war is being fought for a just cause With regard to jus in bello contingent pacifist may worry that innocent noncombatants are being harmed or that soldiers are employing means mala in se such as rape or torture Finally with regard to jus post bellum contingent pacifists may object to wars that will undermine long term peace justice and stability A fourth form of contingent pacifism might be called political pacifism This approach adheres to pacifism as a strategic political commitment within an adversarial system In political discourse the so called doves are usually not absolute pacifists Rather they define themselves in opposition to the hawks who advocate war and funding for the war system Political pacifists need not have an absolute commitment to nonviolence nor need they have a principled commitment to the ideas of the just war theory Rather they can reject militaristic policies for strategic political purposes that have to do with budget priorities or other issues Political pacifism may seem to be merely opportunistic but opposition parties who offer critical perspectives on militarism are an important component of adversarial democracy Moreover political pacifists can end up forming useful coalitions with other more principled pacifists and absolute pacifists Finally another version of contingent pacifism can be called following Robert Holmes liberal democratic or liberal pacifism Holmes argues that modern warfare runs counter to the values of liberal democracy Thus those who are committed to liberal values should not support war Essential for this claim is the idea that no one has a right to command others to kill and no one is justified in killing on command Holmes The sort of pacifism that is derived from this claim is contingent upon the fact that modern warfare involves a hierarchically organized military system and mass conscription It is possible that war could be fought without conscription or without military hierarchy but Holmes argues that this is unlikely in the modern world Moreover this sort of pacifism is contingent upon our social and political commitments Those who are committed to other social and political ideologies may find that war and the war system are morally and politically acceptable Contingent pacifism is often based upon empirical and historical judgments about the way wars are fought Such judgments will vary depending upon changing circumstances And these judgments are also contingent upon the availability of information about why and how wars are fought It is possible then that contingent pacifists can admit that there may be conflicting judgments about the justice of a particular war Unlike contingent pacifism absolute pacifism rejects war in an a priori fashion one of the first principles of absolute pacifism is that war or violence more generally is always wrong Thus absolute pacifism will claim that any judgment that leads to the justification of war is wrong The difference between maximal or broad and minimal or narrow pacifism has to do with the extent of the commitment to nonviolence This difference can be explained with reference to the questions of what sorts of violence are rejected and who is the recipient or beneficiary of nonviolent concern Pacifists reject violence and war But there is an open question about how war and violence are defined and thus about what sorts of actions are rejected by pacifists There is of course a continuum between maximal and minimal pacifism with maximal pacifism rejecting all forms of war and violence Minimal versions of pacifism fall away from this in various directions Maximal pacifism is closely related to absolute and universal formulations of pacifism minimal pacifism has more in common with contingent and particular versions of pacifism There are a variety of actions that can be described as war terrorism insurgency civil war humanitarian intervention full fledged inter state conflict and world war that includes the possible employment of nuclear weapons Most pacifists will reject nuclear war and full fledged inter state conflict But there are differences about whether for example civil war or humanitarian intervention can be justified For example some who could be described as pacifists supported the use of military force during the American Civil War William Lloyd Garrison for example compromised his pacifist beliefs to support the cause of emancipating the slaves At issue in thinking about these differences are questions about the importance of key values such as sovereignty and human rights as well as the question of how best to create stability in the face of social unrest One difficult issue for some pacifists is the question of using violence in defense of human rights or in opposition to tyranny Maximal pacifists will reject all use of military force even in defense against dictators or in response to human rights violations Maximal versions of pacifism will condemn all taking of life Pacifists may also extend their rejection of violence to include a rejection of the death penalty meat eating and abortion More narrow versions of pacifism may take into account the distinction between the innocent and the guilty holding only that the innocent may not be harmed This distinction is important for thinking about the question of noncombatant immunity in war with many pacifists arguing that war is wrong because it puts the innocent at risk Some opponents of the death penalty will make a similar argument about the death penalty and the risk of executing the innocent And opponents of abortion will also claim that it harms the innocent The connection between war the death penalty and abortion is made in the Catholic seamless garment approach to the problem of developing a consistent ethic of life This approach condemns all actions that harm innocent persons and it is often extended toward a rejection of all harm without regard for the distinction between innocence and guilt Such a view has been defended most famously by Pope John Paul II who rejected or was skeptical toward all sorts of violence including war the death penalty suicide euthanasia and abortion Pacifists may also extend moral concern to include concern for all sentient beings and thus pacifists may also condemn meat eating and animal cruelty Gandhi for example extended ahimsa maximally to include avoiding harm to sentient beings This distinction has to do with the issue of whether everyone is required to be a pacifist or whether pacifism can be a moral choice of some particular individuals This is related to the question of whether pacifism is a duty for all or whether it supererogatory While the distinction between universal and particular pacifism is related to the distinction between absolute and contingent pacifism it is primarily focused on the question of who is obligated by pacifism Universalism in thinking about pacifism will hold that if war is wrong it is wrong for everyone and thus that soldiers who fight are wrong as are those who support the war system that encourages them to fight Particular pacifists articulate their position as merely personal and do not condemn the war system or soldiers who choose to fight Universal pacifism is closely connected with absolute and maximal versions of pacifism particular pacifism is related to contingent and minimal pacifisms One way that this distinction between universal and particular pacifism has been enacted in history is through the idea of vocational pacifism discussed above Vocational pacifism holds that pacifism is a special obligation of a particular vocational service but that it is not required of all In this sense pacifism is a supererogatory obligation Religious clerics may thus be required to renounce violence while ordinary members of their congregations may not be so obliged Particular pacifism is thus connected to contingent pacifism the moral demand of pacifism may be contingent upon one social position This distinction can be understood by considering whether pacifism is morally necessary or whether it is merely morally permitted The universalist answer to this question is if war and violence are wrong then pacifism is morally necessary and those who fight are wrong But some pacifist appear to hold that it is not wrong to fight or that some persons are permitted to fight even though the pacifists herself may choose or is obliged by some vocational commitment not to fight A conscientious objector may thus choose not to fight while not condemning those who do Conscientious refusal may be articulated as a personal belief about pacifism that does not apply to others This is one way pacifists who refuse to fight may avoid the charge that they are traitors who are opposed to their compatriots who fight they may deny that their refusal has any universal moral significance or application Eric Reitan has argued that one may adopt a sort of personal pacifism that need not be universally applied One way of understanding this is to connect it with the idea of tolerance A personal pacifist may believe that pacifism is the right choice but she may choose to tolerate others who do not make the same choice A personal pacifist may also espouse a sort of relativism that holds that a commitment to pacifism is merely a personal commitment that cannot be used to condemn others who make different commitments This idea of particular pacifism is a subtle one And critics will argue that it is incoherent especially if it is understood as a sort of relativism Those who claim that conscientious objectors are traitors may argue that pacifism cannot be a particular or personal choice Critics of pacifism will argue that pacifism is morally wrong because they think that patriotism or justice requires fighting or at least supporting the war effort This objection would hold that if a war is justified then conscientious objectors are wrong to reject it Particularists may reply by claiming that their rejection of war is a personal choice without universal significance Arguments in defense of pacifism are usually based on assertions about the immorality of violence and war Thus pacifism is usually derived by negation Pacifism primarily tells us what not to do As Cheyney Ryan has argued pacifism is a skeptical position As Ryan puts this its general claim is that the proponent of killing cannot produce a single compelling argument for why killing another person is permissible Ryan One of the skeptical problems that Ryan addresses is the problem that occurs in killing in self defense When a Victim kills an Aggressor in self defense this killing occurs before the Aggressor has actualized his malicious intention In this case killing in self defense is out of proportion to the harm done since the Victim who kills in self defense was not himself killed A skeptical version of pacifism can thus develop from the worry that when we choose to kill in self defense we never know whether this killing is in fact justifiable This sort of skeptical position can be linked to the just war tradition concern with the question of last resort in thinking about jus ad bellum Skeptical pacifists wonder how we would know that we ever reach the stage of last resort when violence becomes necessary One way that pacifists articulate this concern is to focus on the variety of nonviolent measures that could be employed before it becomes necessary to resort to force Indeed it may be argued that to resort to violence is to admit to a failure of imagination and to give up hope that more humane forms of problem solving and conflict resolution can be effective Moreover pacifists will note that it is not sufficient to try nonviolent methods once and then disregard them Rather one must engage in a variety of nonviolent actions and one must try these nonviolent alternatives more than once A somewhat different version of skeptical pacifism can be found in critiques of militarism and the ideology and propaganda that lead people to support war This skeptical stance has been defended by the author of the present entry Fiala and In this approach skepticism produces a practical political pacifism that is based upon the fact that citizens have no good reason to trust that their governments are telling them the truth about war and its justification This skepticism is derived from historical judgments about the tendency of governments to manipulate information in order to provoke the citizenry toward war In light of such skepticism the burden of proof for the justification of war is placed upon the government who must prove that the dangerous and presumptively immoral activity of war can in fact be justified This sort of skepticism might also be called prima facie pacifism this is the idea that war is usually wrong except in certain extraordinary circumstances when it is compellingly shown that the evil of war is a sort of lesser evil that is necessary for some greater good Prima facie pacifism presumes that war is wrong but allows for exceptions Prima facie pacifism places the burden of proof upon the proponent of war it is up to the proponent of war to prove in a given circumstance that war is in fact morally necessary Transformational pacifism is understood as aiming at a transformation of psychological cultural social and moral sensibility away from acceptance of violence and war Transformational pacifism articulates a broad framework of cultural criticism and includes an effort to reform educational and cultural practices that tend to support violence and war The goal of transformational pacifism is a world in which war and violence appear to be archaic remnants of less civilized past One traditional version of transformational pacifism can be found in pacifist religious traditions For example Jesus articulated a revaluation of values from the standpoint of a more pacific understanding of God commandments Instead of retaliation and the logic of an eye for eye Jesus claimed that we must evolve a new idea of not returning evil for evil Transformational pacifism is often connected to a progressive interpretation of history that points toward a pacifist goal for human evolution Gandhi thought that such progress was already underway and that history has been steadily progressing towards ahimsa nonviolence Gandhi Transformational pacifism has been described by Joseph Fahey who also calls it reconstructionist pacifism as follows transformational pacifists stress the spiritual unity of all people they seek not only the abolition of war but also the creation of an international juridical political and economic order that will promote the rights of all species Fahey War resistance can be located under this general rubric insofar as war resistance is linked to a general criticism of those structures of authority economic and political choices and institutional frameworks that support what is often called the war system see Atack Transformational pacifism can also be linked to feminism and feminist critiques of the masculine values found in warrior cultures and the war system Nobel Peace Prize winner Jane Addams is a prominent figure here Addams connected her pragmatic hope for peace to democracy and the empowerment of women and the oppressed masses who had in the past silently suffered from the horrors of war During World War I Addams and her Women Peace Party worked to end the war and eventually ended up creating the Women International League for Peace and Freedom More recently authors such as Sara Ruddick and Nel Noddings have connected feminist criticism with pacifism and the ethics of care Ruddick notes that military thinking utilizes a variety of conceptual strategies that create a myth of the manly just warrior which interlocks myths of masculinity sacrifice and heroic death Ruddick Noddings has noted that care ethics does not support absolute pacifism since care givers may in rare circumstances kill in order to defend those they love Nonetheless Noddings argues that care ethics and feminism are concerned with a general critique of the militaristic and violent assumptions of male dominant culture Noddings contends that our culture puts a high value on the aggressive tendencies of males Noddings Her solution is to re create culture and education in such as way as to devalue aggression and provide support for love nurturance solidarity and care Consequentialist Pacifism Deontological prohibitions against war are usually absolute while consequentialist prohibitions against war are for the most part contingent Consequentialist pacifism is usually grounded in some sort of rule utilitarianism A utilitarian pacifist may argue that a rule against war or other sorts of violence will tend to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number A broader prohibition against violence other than war can extend the greatest happiness concept to take into account the happiness of sentient beings other than humans Utilitarian pacifists must appeal to empirical and historical data to support this rule A utilitarian argument for pacifism could be grounded in the claim that history shows us that wars tend to produce more harm than good As Bentham put it The happiest of mankind are sufferers by war and the wisest nay even the least wise are wise enough to ascribe the chief of their sufferings to that cause Bentham Fourth Essay One of the problems for consequentialist arguments against war is that judgments vary about whether war always causes more suffering than it prevents Utilitarian defenders of the just war theory will argue that some wars help alleviate suffering as for example in the case of humanitarian wars in defense of human rights Utilitarian pacifists may articulate a rule based argument that holds that a general rule against war will in the long run produce more happiness A utilitarian might support such an argument by also arguing that economic and other resources that are spent on war and preparation for war could produce more happiness if spent on peaceful goods such as education hunger relief and so on And a rule utilitarian might argue that a rule against humanitarian intervention would produce more happiness in the long run by protecting international stability and preserving important values like national sovereignty It is important to note that unlike deontological pacifism consequentialist pacifism is not opposed to killing per se Nor is the consequentialist approach especially concerned with the distinction between combatants and noncombatants since the greatest happiness principle adopts a perspective that includes both combatants and noncombatants Indeed the combatant noncombatant distinction is better understood as a deontological principle as discussed below It is difficult to see how absolute pacifism can develop from act utilitarianism that is devoid of side constraints against killing The rule utilitarian approach can however allow for general rules that allow killing in certain circumstances say in self defense The idea of proportionality in just war theory is an example of such a rule killing in war is justifiable if it promotes general long term happiness The claim that war produces more harm than good is disputable at least it requires empirical research to decide if it is true Empirical research into the consequences of war provides mixed results depending upon contexts and circumstances in which wars are fought and the range of consequences considered whether short term or long term Some authors Pinker and Goldstein suggest that the use of judicious military power during the last several decades has produced good results But other authors reach different conclusions Ian Bickerton concludes that the wars of the past years have produced ambiguous results victory did not achieve its desired results and war sacrifices were largely in vain The reality is that the costs of war are rarely if ever worthwhile Bickerton xi Given the difficulty of assessing the empirical data consequentialist pacifism will usually be a sort of contingent pacifism But this is not always true since absolute pacifism might be justifiable on consequentialist grounds as a rule that will in the long run produce good consequences There may be variable judgments among consequentialists about whether some wars produce more harm than good Thus pacifists such as Einstein and Russell could agree that the First World War was wrong while admitting that the Second World War could be justified The Second World War is in fact often used as an example of a war that can be justified in consequentialist terms the good produced by the war the defeat of Nazism in Europe for example is thought to outweigh its negative consequences especially the massive numbers of persons killed in the war In response consequentialist pacifists might emphasize the negative utility of the deaths caused by the war while also arguing that the Second World War produced long term negative consequences with the introduction of nuclear weapons the partition of Europe and the madness of the Cold War Consequentialist defenders of pacifism will also argue that creative and coordinated nonviolent action can produce good consequences that are at least as good as the consequences of war One of the issues that consequentialists must consider is the temporal and spatial scope of our concern for consequences It is possible that wars may produce short term benefits for some and long term disadvantages for others Judgments about benefits and harms are thus complex and we must clarify our understanding of what matters in thinking about consequences Often consequentialist arguments for pacifism emphasize the short term damage of war It is obviously true that wars kill people But the further question to be asked from the standpoint of consequentialism is whether the harms that occur in the near term are outweighed by the long term benefits of the war Just war theorists believe that some wars do have positive long term consequences Pacifists do not think that long term benefits outweigh such near term harms Consequentialist pacifists often also consider the broad and long term negative effects of war on the economy on culture on political life and on the environment Moreover pacifists worry that war contributes to long term international instability When thinking about the negative consequences of war it is important to recognize that we are engaged in comparative cost benefit analysis Critics of consequentialist pacifism often skew the results of such cost benefit analysis by comparing war to passivity or inaction But most forms of pacifism do not advocate complete passivity It is a mistake to compare the consequences of going to war to the consequences of doing nothing Rather the cost benefit analysis must compare the costs and benefits of going to war against those of creative organized and sustained nonviolent action A further consequentialist argument claims that cultures and states that fight wars tend to become militaristic and expansionist This argument focuses on the long term negative consequences of a social and political system that is committed to militarism One of these negative consequences is the rise of the so called military industrial complex in which social capital is expended on military infrastructure at the expense of other social projects A negative consequence of militarism is the tendency of militarist states to become centralized secretive and imperial This critique of military expansionism can be connected to a general critique of the potential negative consequences of imperial power One such negative consequence is found in the illiberal tendencies of military power Another negative consequence can be found in the possibility of blow back or retaliation in which those who are subjugated turn against the colonial power And other negative consequences include the danger of an arms races and the wasted money and energy that are spent on preparing for war Empirical research is required to say whether it is true that what pacifists often call the war system does produce these negative political consequences Judgment about these empirical facts will likely vary in accord with historical geographical and political differences as well as in light of which consequences we chose to emphasize Thus while pacifists argue that resources are squandered in war and environmentalists will point out the military is one of the largest polluters on the planet proponents of war argue that war and the military produces goods and technologies such as airplanes satellites and so on that are useful for civilians Ruttan Another consequentialist argument can be located in the idea of the sort of just war pacifism that developed during the late Century The worry of just war pacifism is that modern wars fought with weapons of mass destruction can never be justified There are deontological concerns behind this sort of pacifism with regard to concern for noncombatants But there are also consequentialist reasons to be skeptical of wars fought with weapons of mass destruction most notably the problem of escalation Nuclear deterrent strategy relies upon the threat of escalation to keep antagonists in check The idea of deterrent strategy is to make the negative consequences of war for the enemy so horrifying that war will not occur But if the threat of escalation is real and the results of war are really so atrocious then there are good consequentialist reasons to be opposed to war wars fought with weapons of mass destruction will tend to produce horrifying consequences including the potentially total devastation of what was called during the Cold War mutually assured destruction During the Cold War this concern was located in the worry about nuclear winter which was the catastrophic destruction of the earth climate and biosphere that would occur if an all out nuclear war had erupted Even more limited conflicts that occur among states that possess weapons of mass destruction could produce horrible consequences Nuclear proliferation remains a concern along with the general threat of terrorists in possession of weapons of mass destruction Just war pacifists generally claim that the negative consequences of modern war make war unjustifiable Just war pacifism might be more narrowly focused on the immorality of nuclear war and nuclear deterrence strategy But those who reject nuclear warfare might still allow that limited defensive or even humanitarian wars can be fought provided we could be sure that just war principles were respected Perhaps the most important conclusion of just war pacifism is that the burden of proof rests on the proponent of war for just war pacifists who base their conclusions on consequentialist reasoning war is presumed to produce negative consequences until is proved otherwise Related to these consequentialist arguments against war is a more positive consequentialist argument about the positive power of nonviolence as a social force This is grounded in a consequentialist argument that active nonviolence can produce social goods like respect for human rights as well as peace and reconciliation The basic theory and strategy of nonviolent action were worked out by Mohandas Gandhi Martin Luther King Jr Cesar Chavez Gene Sharp and others who were engaged in nonviolent social protest in the Century Although the roots of this approach can be found in the long history of pacifism from Jesus onward the Gandhi King approach both clarified the basic principles of nonviolent resistance and successfully put these principles into action in the Indian struggle for self determination and in the American civil rights movement One of the important contributions of this approach is the idea that there should be a coordination between means and ends Peaceful means should be employed in pursuit of the end of peace and justice For peaceful means of social change to be effective they must be coordinated and organized Gandhi and King thought that the power of nonviolence was linked to its ability to motivate and move large numbers of people Pacifism as a personal stance will not be effective at creating social change it requires a coordinated social effort Proponents of active nonviolence will claim that coordinated nonviolence can be successful even in the face of aggression Advocates of this position will point to the successes of Gandhi and King They will also point to the velvet revolutions that occurred in Eastern Europe in the late and early And they will point to the example of Lithuania in when unarmed civilians succeeded in turning back Soviet troops Some initially viewed the so called Arab Spring that began in late as an example of the power of nonviolence However subsequent oppression by military and police forces remind us of the fragility of nonviolent social movements Proponents of nonviolent action argue that nonviolence could be even more effective if society focused its resources on training citizens for nonviolent resistance and on coordinating nonviolent action The ideal here would be a sort of nonviolent army that is funded trained and coordinated for national self defense in a way that mimics military training For pacifism to be effective the social resources money technology and investment of labor and creative power that are currently used for military training would have to be converted to nonviolent applications This idea draws on what James called the moral equivalent of war and what Gandhi called the nonviolent army Deontological Pacifism Deontological pacifism is closely related to absolute pacifism Deontological approaches to morality focus on duty and right One typical idea for deontological pacifism is that there is a basic law or principle that prohibits killing such as thou shall not kill The most famous theory of deontological ethics is Kant Kant categorical imperative is formulated as follows Act according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law Kant It is difficult to supply content to this imperative Thus it is not clear that the Kantian imperative can be used to rule out war Indeed Kant is a defender of a version of the just war theory in part because he believes that states have a duty to defend their citizens Although Kant is not himself a pacifist one might be able to ground pacifism in Kant alternative version of the moral law Act so that you treat humanity whether in your own person or in that of another always as an end and never as a means only Kant Some pacifists use the second formulation of the categorical imperative to support their position by claiming that war treats persons as means and does not respect them as ends in themselves One version of this idea has been defended by Soran Reader who argues that the basic presumption of the moral status of persons leads to pacifism Although Reader argues that one can arrive at this perspective from both a consequentialist approach and a Kantian one she relies on the basic intuition that respect for persons as ends in themselves requires us not to kill them It is possible to use this deontological principle to support a maximal extension of pacifism such that the prohibition against killing might be extended to include a prohibition against killing non human persons This interpretation would obviously require a further analysis of the notion of personhood In addition to killing human persons war violates the moral status of persons when for example soldiers are viewed as interchangeable cogs in the war machine One might then criticize the apparent herd mentality of militarism as Albert Einstein did when he called the militaristic patriotism of the masses a sort of loathsome nonsense Einstein The idea of conscription seems to run counter to the idea of respect for persons And pacifists may argue that it is somehow disrespectful to require soldiers to conform to military virtues such as obedience to authority Arguments against militarism along these lines were made famous by Thoreau who claimed that in military service the mass of men serve the State thus not as men mainly but as machines with their bodies Thoreau The more important critique of the way that war betrays human dignity can be found in the pacifist critique of the killing that happens in war Pacifists might claim that war is a violation of human rights More concretely the pacifist may claim that all human beings have a right to life and that killing in war violates this right This idea has been rejected by Anscombe Narveson and others who argue that the idea of human dignity or human rights can necessitate the use of violence in defense of these rights This sort of objection holds that it is both inconsistent and immoral for pacifists to reject the use of violence in defense of human rights As David Luban puts this Such rights are worth fighting for They are worth fighting for not only by those to whom they are denied but if we take seriously the obligation which is indicated when we speak of human rights by the rest of us as well Luban One of the ways that pacifists can reply to this objection is to emphasize the difference between personal nonviolence and war Pacifists may accept that personal self defense is acceptable and they may accept the idea of using violence in defense of the innocent in concrete personal encounters Of course absolute pacifists who emphasized complete nonresistance will not accept such violence at all But pacifism as anti warism will argue that the violence of war is of a different kind War is dehumanizing violence that kills masses of persons without any concern for them as persons Along these lines Thomas Nagel claims that we should be able to justify to the victim what is being done to them in light of morally relevant facts about them At the level of personal violence it is possible to say that an aggressor deserves the violence that is inflicted upon him But at the level of war this personal element is lost and instead we have killing en masse which is an assault on human dignity One aspect of the deontological condemnation of war focuses on the killing of combatants A pacifist might argue that it is wrong to kill enemy combatants because killing is always wrong Such an argument runs counter to the just war ideal that combatants can be killed Critics will argue that pacifism thus fails to distinguish between innocence and guilt As Anscombe puts this pacifism teaches people to make no distinction between the shedding of innocent blood and the shedding of any human blood Anscombe The just war tradition holds that it is permissible to kill enemy combatants because these combatants are in some sense no longer innocent Those who claim that it is acceptable to kill enemy combatants claim that enemy soldiers deserve to die or at least that it is not wrong to kill them There are open questions in just war theory about how this notion of desert functions One of the problems is that young conscripted soldiers may not fully support the war into which they are drafted and thus it may seem odd to claim that such soldiers are guilty for or deserve to be killed in a war for which they hold no personal responsibility see McMahan But the most obvious way to justify killing combatants is to link such killing to the notion of self defense In war soldiers are confronted with enemy combatants who will kill them and their comrades if they aren killed first In the language of just war theory an enemy combatant is guilty of the crime of aggression and in the context of war this crime is punishable by death This notion of killing as punishment can easily be connected to the issue of the death penalty For deontological proponents of the death penalty murderers can be executed because the nature of their crime merits death While consequentialists add in other considerations such as the deterrent value of the death penalty the deontological approach focuses on the moral desert that is connected to the guilt of the murderer This notion of guilt as a moral quality that adheres to an individual in light of his past actions is also found in the idea that enemy combatants may be killed Those individuals who are engaged in fighting have done something or have adopted some characteristic that makes it permissible to kill them Absolute and maximal versions of deontological pacifism maintain that killing is never permitted even the killing of enemy soldiers They may also claim that the death penalty is wrong and they may deny that killing in self defense is ever justifiable Opponents of war may also deny that international aggression is punishable by death A more subtle argument along these lines will claim that it is wrong to kill enemy combatants because enemy combatants are occasionally or usually depending on the strength of this particular claim not responsible for their participation in war This is especially true of conscript armies who are forced to fight A pacifist might want to make an exception for killing soldiers who have malicious intent but they may argue that it is immoral to kill soldiers who are forced to fight Although some maximal versions of deontological pacifism will claim that it is wrong even to kill combatants in war other versions will argue that war is wrong primarily because of the risk to noncombatants A cherished principle of the just war tradition is the idea of noncombatant immunity This idea holds that those not actually engaged in the fighting should not be put at risk and should not be deliberately targeted This idea is often connected to the idea that the innocent should not be killed Noncombatants are presumed to be innocent and thus immune from being killed There is an open question as to whether all noncombatants are really innocent But the just war tradition stipulates that noncombatants should be immune from intentional harm A version of pacifism can thus be derived from this principle of the just war tradition by arguing against wars that do in fact end up killing innocent noncombatants Just war pacifists will argue that this is especially true given the nature of modern warfare which includes the use of mechanized weapons aerial bombardment and weapons of mass destruction Such weaponry does not adequately discriminate between combatants and noncombatants Thus modern war cannot be just according to the pacifist interpretation of the just war tradition The just war tradition however allows that innocent noncombatants may be killed according to the principle of double effect This idea is derived in the Christian tradition from Aquinas who holds that a single act may have two effects Aquinas uses an example of killing in self defense the act has one effect of saving a life but another effect of killing the aggressor Killing an aggressor in self defense may be permitted if the death of the aggressor is not the primary intention of the defensive act It is significant that Aquinas does not expand this discussion to make it permissible to kill an innocent third party But the just war tradition has employed this idea in a way that makes it permissible to kill innocent third parties noncombatants in war so long as the primary intention is to accomplish a legitimate war aim and so long as the killing of innocents is merely a foreseen but unintended secondary effect Absolute pacifists will argue against this employment of the doctrine of double effect and will claim that the killing of the innocent in war is always wrong even if it is an unintended effect Indeed some pacifists may also claim that since we know that war will kill noncombatants it is disingenuous to claim that the deaths of innocent noncombatants are not intended The pacifist may claim that the real problem of war is that noncombatants are killed intentionally as a means of warfare Although Anscombe argued against pacifism she made a similar argument in her criticism of the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki it is nonsense to pretend that you do not intend to do what is the means you take to your chosen end Anscombe thought that war could be justified if it did not directly intend to kill noncombatants And Anscombe thought that pacifists were wrong to ignore the distinction between shedding innocent blood and shedding blood in just warfare But pacifist might argue in response that war is wrong because innocent noncombatants are killed whether intentionally or not Pacifism that is absolutist and deontological is often grounded in religious belief Christian philosopher Stanley Hauerwas has claimed that pacifism is a theological position because it is as much about eschatological faith as it is about ethics and politics Hauerwas A variety of religions have supported pacifist positions Hindus Jains and Buddhists share a concern for ahimsa or nonviolence as a basic moral virtue Likewise Christians also find a commitment to nonviolence at the heart of their tradition One reason that absolutist and deontological pacifism appears to require a religious foundation is that the commitment to peace can lead to suffering in the real world of political life But for some religious believers the world of political life is only an apparent world and not the real world at all In the Buddhist tradition the world of dependent arising is a world of appearances in which suffering is ubiquitous One of the ways to overcome this suffering is to see through the veil of maya and the illusions of this world Ahimsa or nonviolence is a virtue that renounces the ubiquitous violence of the real world In a different way the Christian tradition holds that the city of God or divine providence is a mysterious reality that is infinitely more important than the reality of the city of Man The structure of this sort of religious belief is closely related to the absolute deontological and transformational nature of religious pacifism In Christian pacifism it is God commandments as articulated by Jesus that necessitate a commitment to pacifism Of course this is a contentious point and some deny that Christianity requires pacifism see Fiala But Christian pacifists maintain that Christians should refuse to kill regardless of the consequences in the real world Related to this is the faith that God will provide both the strength to endure suffering and a final reward for those who remain committed to principles of nonviolence Even though pacifism may seem imprudent or even idiotic from the standpoint of consequentialism or political realism these consequences have no lasting significance from the standpoint of Providence Indeed religious pacifists are not averse to the pain that they might suffer as a result of their refusal to take part in violence because they believe that this suffering will be redeemed in the larger structure of divine justice A further variety of religious pacifism is closely connected with the ideas of virtue ethics Virtue ethics emphasizes the cultivation of virtues over the course of a lifetime Virtue ethicists are reluctant to judge actions in isolation from the total context of an individual life Religious pacifism has a virtue ethics component when the commitment to peace is conceived as a lifelong project of personal transformation In the Christian tradition this is understood as a project in which human beings learn to imitate Jesus in order to become closer to God The Christian model of virtue is Jesus and Jesus practice of nonviolence culminated in his crucifixion Christian martyrs have looked to this paradigm for millennia A similar idea about the practice of nonviolence is found in the Indian traditions Gandhi practice of self renunciation brahmacharya including his vow of poverty and his fasts were closely tied to his commitment to ahimsa For Gandhi nonviolence is part of a total practice of virtue In the Buddhist tradition this is developed for example in Thich Nhat Hahn idea of being peace The virtue approach emphasizes that pacifism is a lifelong project that requires discipline and practice This is true because we are not born virtuous Rather we learn to cultivate the virtue of peacefulness by gradually learning habits that help us control and resist anger hatred pride competitiveness and the other emotions that lead to violence In the Christian tradition this is linked to the idea of original sin we are born in violence and have to learn to overcome violence Theological questions arise in Christianity about whether human beings can overcome violence by themselves or whether grace is needed in order to cultivate the virtue of peace It is possible to develop a version of virtue pacifism from a non religious standpoint In the ancient world some versions of Stoicism and Epicureanism come close to this Stoics for example emphasize the virtue of tranquility or undisturbedness One attains this state by learning proper discipline and by cultivating the other virtues that are essential for reigning in hubris Hubris is wanton violence or pride run amok Since Plato the Greek tradition has claimed that justice courage moderation and wisdom were needed to overcome hubris It is conceivable that these virtues would conjoin in a sort of peacefulness Indeed one can see the roots of nonviolent social protest in Socrates nonresistance to the Athenian state It should be noted however that although Socrates refused to carry out unjust orders he did serve the state in battle A non religious version of virtue pacifism can be found in the ideas of Century humanists such as William James At the beginning of the Century James acknowledged that war and military service did produce certain virtues such as courage and discipline But James hoped that there could be a non military way of producing these virtues This was the basic idea behind his proposal for a moral equivalent to war which was an attempt to find a way to produce virtues without connecting them to militarism The general rejection of war has a long history that parallels the just war tradition and its idea that wars should be fought for the sake of peace and justice In the West pacifism and the just war tradition have roots in both Christian and non Christian sources For Christian thinkers one of the primary problems is trying to reconcile the pacific commandments of Jesus with the apparent moral necessity of using war to defend the innocent This problem is acute for Christians since Jesus seems to advocate an ethic of nonviolence both in the Sermon on the Mount and in his submission to violence while Augustine and others use both Biblical sources such as Paul letter to the Romans and natural law to argue in favor of the just war idea In the Western tradition pacifism is an ideal that develops alongside of and in contrast to the just war tradition with adherents of pacifism including the Mennonites and Quakers as well as Christian humanists such as Erasmus The problem of justifying war is also found in Greek thinkers such as Plato who argued in the Laws that war should only be waged for the sake of peace and that it is peace in which each of us should spend most of his life and spend it best And in the Crito Socrates considers the problem of whether it is ever justified to return evil for evil Socrates begins with the assumption that we must do no harm and he and Crito agree at one point that one ought not retaliate or render evil for evil to anyone whatever evil we may have suffered from him It seems that this idea is behind Socrates decision to remain in prison and allow himself to be executed Pacifism shows up in non Western traditions as well Jains Buddhists and others in the Indian tradition share a commitment to ahimsa or nonviolence as a cardinal virtue The ideal in these traditions is a sort of selflessness in which through the dissolution of the self a larger truth emerges For Buddhists this is based upon the idea of nonattachment war violence anger and hatred result from our attachment to material things Ahimsa is also linked to the idea that all sentient beings are interdependent Thus nonviolence is extended toward a rejection of violence toward sentient beings in general and a commitment to vegetarianism Mohandas Gandhi is perhaps the most famous adherent of ahimsa of the last century Gandhi based his commitment to nonviolence on a spiritual foundation that emphasized self renunciation brahmacharya and the positive action of the force of love or force of truth that he called satyagraha It is important to note that the distinction between Western and non Western traditions breaks down in the Century Gandhi was inspired by Thoreau and by Tolstoy and Gandhi in turn inspired Western pacifists such as Albert Einstein Bertrand Russell and Martin Luther King Jr Gandhi and King both claim that one of the most important ideas underlying this sort of pacifism is love especially the disinterested brotherly love that is described in the Greek New Testament using the word agape King explains it this way In the final analysis agape means recognition of the fact that all life is interrelated All humanity is involved in a single process and all men are brothers To the degree that I harm my brother no matter what he is doing to me to that extent I am harming myself King This idea represents the extension of Christian pacifism in light of Gandhian principles Further discussions should consider how such ideas have spread to Latin America East Asia and the Muslim world as well as the ways that nonviolence shows up in the religious and philosophical traditions of the rest of the world Research projects in pacifism and peace studies should continue to explore ideas found in the variety of world traditions including Taoism African thought and indigenous American philosophies Here we will summarize briefly several objections to pacifism and pacifist replies to these objections These objections and replies will of course vary according to the different sorts of pacifism being attacked or defended Objection This objection holds that the reason pacifists advocate nonviolence is that they are afraid of suffering from violence or that they are too lazy or self interested to take up arms to fight This objection focuses on the motivation and psychology of pacifists and accuses pacifists of the vice of cowardice Moreover such an objection may also argue that pacifists are egoists who are too selfish to do what is required to serve justice protect the innocent and defend the nation The free rider objection adds that pacifists benefit from social goods that are produced through military power while they contribute nothing substantial to the production of these goods This objection thus claims that pacifism is unjust since pacifists share in social benefits without also taking up the burdens and obligations that are tied to these benefits Related to this is the charge that pacifism is unpatriotic and even treasonous The concern here is that if pacifists are unwilling to fight to defend the nation then they effectively betray the nation and help the enemy As Jan Narveson has recently put this pacifists have too many friends Narveson since they are unwilling to take up arms against their enemies A more forceful ad hominem argument against pacifism can be found in Ward Churchill idea that pacifism is a pathology of the privileged a point that has been reiterated by Derek Jensen This objection holds that it is easy for those who are not oppressed to advocate nonviolence and indeed that the powerful can use the ideology of pacifism as a tool with which to further oppress those who are unwilling to take up arms in defense of human rights This idea can be traced back to ideas found in Marcuse who argued that the weaker parties in social conflict are forced by the stronger party to employ nonviolence and thus that resort to nonviolence is both ineffective and an admission of weakness Reply One way that a pacifist might reply to this objection is to argue that pacifism results from noble motives and not vicious ones To support this reply pacifists might show examples of the virtuous individuals who have advocated pacifism while also emphasizing the ethical basis on which pacifism is grounded Indeed pacifists can avoid the cowardice objection by stressing that pacifists are willing to suffer violence even though they refuse to participate in it With regard to the free rider problem a principled pacifist can argue that her moral principles require that she be a pacifist and that these principles also require that she work to transform society Moreover pacifists can engage in productive social endeavors that do not necessitate the use of violence or war This sort of compromise occurs when military states find ways to employ the talents of conscientious objectors Pacifists who refuse to fight can volunteer their talents and energies in nonviolent activities that support the common good With regard to the accusation of treason a pacifist might claim that there are higher goods than the state Indeed some pacifists such as Tolstoy or Hauerwas are also anarchists who claim that Christian faith requires that one overcome one attachment to the state as well as one hatred of enemies A similar argument can be made against Churchill pacifism as pathology objection with principled pacifists claiming that nonviolence is a moral requirement that transcends class and national ideology Finally a consequentialist pacifist can reply that she is concerned with the long term interests of the community and not with the short term question of winning a war or staging a revolution While violence may create short term benefits the long term project of creating a stable peace will require nonviolent means and projects focused on reconciliation and restorative justice And contra the Churchill Jensen objection pacifists will emphasize the moral and political importance of unifying means and end Pacifists are wrong to aspire for the purity of clean hands and pacifism is based on bad theology Objection The clean hands objection holds that pacifists are so committed to keeping their hands clean that they fail to act on other requirements of life The clean hands objection holds that pacifists are disconnected from the world of concrete human reality As Anscombe puts this in her critique of pacifism the pacifist holds withdrawal from the world as man only salvation Anscombe This is tied to a theological objection that holds that pacifists incorrectly believe that they can overcome the limits of human nature A version of this objection that is often directed against Christian pacifism holds that war will remain necessary because of the fallen and sinful nature of human beings This objection also reminds Christian pacifists that there is explicit advocacy for war in the Old Testament and that Paul letter to the Romans allows the sovereign to use the sword to execute God wrath The objection holds that since we are not perfect we must employ the imperfect means of war and violence to attain moral ends From this standpoint defenders of the idea of a just war argue that love of the neighbor and the need for a just social order will occasionally necessitate just wars Reply Pacifists might reply to this sort of objection by delving deeper into the requirements of both religious faith and ethics This objection is tied to a much larger problem of coordinating the demands of ordinary political life with the requirements of morality and religion Christian pacifists will reply to the bad theology objection by focusing on the message of Jesus in the Gospels and they will argue as John Howard Yoder does that just war theory is a later development of a lapsed sort of Constantinian or Augustinian Christianity Moreover Christian pacifists will argue that pacifism is part of a religious worldview that looks beyond a materialistic defense of the finite goods of this world For religiously oriented pacifists in many traditions a commitment to nonviolence is tied to the attempt to see through the vanity of temporal things Nonreligious pacifists will reply to this objection by clarifying the importance of clean hands in morality Absolutists will claim that we have an obligation to uphold the requirements of morality and keep our hands as clean as possible They will also claim that the world would be a better place if everyone took this obligation seriously and refused to compromise with evil Objection This objection claims that pacifism results in a performative contradiction because an absolute pacifist who is unwilling to defend himself simply ends up dead A more subtle version of this argument has been articulated by Jan Narveson Narveson who argued that pacifism involves an internal contradiction that is related to the idea of justice and human rights Pacifists are unwilling to use violence to defend against aggression because they respect life or respect persons But a contradiction occurs when the pacifist who claims that life is an absolute good is unwilling to take the necessary steps to defend lives that are threatened by aggression This objection shares something with those defenders of the just war idea who like George Weigel are inspired by the Augustinian ideal of using war to defend a tranquil and just social order The objection holds that it is immoral to avoid war when war could be used to defend the innocent protect sovereignty and uphold a just international order This objection can be applied both to defensive wars in which the state has an obligation to protect its own citizens and to wars of humanitarian intervention in which military power is used to defend the human rights and to establish domestic tranquility and social order in pursuit of peace Related to this is the claim that nonviolent means of producing social change are ineffective Critics will claim for example that although there appear to be cases of successful nonviolent action in India or in the American civil rights movements these movements were successful because of unique set of historical circumstances Critics will argue that Gandhi success was made possible by British exhaustion from the World Wars and they will argue that Martin Luther King Jr success was made possible by the threat of violence from radicals such as the Black Panthers Moreover critics will argue that Gandhi and King were successful because their opponents were for the most part sympathetic to their cause from the beginning But such critics will argue that non violence will simply not work against Nazis or terrorists and that those who think so are dangerously deluded President Barack Obama articulated this sort of objection to pacifism in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech Obama expressed respect for pacifists such as Gandhi and King He said there is nothing weak nothing passive nothing naive in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King But he claimed that a head of state cannot be guided by pacifism And he concluded A nonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler armies Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda leaders to lay down their arms A similar argument about the efficacy of violence has been made by defenders of insurrectionary violence such as Marcuse Fanon and Sartre Reply One way that a pacifist may reply to this objection is to focus on pacifism as a skeptical political stance about war Some political pacifists do allow for personal self defense and defense of loved ones while remaining skeptical of war as a social movement Another way that a pacifist may reply is to focus on consequences and argue that war produces more negative consequences than nonviolence Against Narveson the pacifist might argue that pacifism is no more contradictory than the idea that we might kill in order to defend life Deontological pacifists will also reply that while they do value a just and tranquil social order and may even be willing to die in defense of such as just order their basic principles prohibit them from killing in its defense A pacifist might further reply to this objection by arguing that the idea that war can be used to defend the innocent is also imprudent and unwise Pacifists will argue that nonviolent means of defending the just political order are the best means to be employed in practice because they remain consistent with the ideals of justice and order that are to be defended This claim about the unity of means and ends can be used to argue against the Fanon Marcuse justification of violence in insurrection by noting a contradiction in revolutionaries using violence to oppose the violence of oppressive states A pacifist might add that history shows that violent revolution often either escalates or provokes more oppression With regard to humanitarian intervention some deontological pacifists will worry that interventions by outsiders will run counter to the national right to self determination And more prudentially minded pacifists will worry that humanitarian intervention will produce resistance and an escalation of violence that will undermine the long term goals of political stabilization justice and reconciliation Finally the pacifist might also appeal to the tragic element in human life that we often have to make tragic choices in which there is no genuinely good alternative When confronted with such tragic conflicts the pacifist will argue that we should err on the side of peace and take care that we do no harm The examples of King and Gandhi may in fact require careful historical analysis and different historical circumstances will require different sorts of nonviolent action But for the pacifist history shows us the horror of war and the success of Gandhi and King reminds us that there is an alternative Finally a pacifist might also point out that the long term goal of a transformation beyond war is shared by a variety of people including those who are reluctant to call themselves pacifists As Obama pointed out in his Nobel Peace Prize speech even if war may be necessary it is also at some level an expression of human folly Pacifists usually deny that war is necessary But they agree that war is usually an expression of human folly The Standard Account of Identity Note The following material is somewhat technical The reader may wish to casually review it now and return to it as needed especially in connection with The propositions Ref LL Ref LL NI and ND are identified in the present section and are referred to as such in the rest of the entry Identity may be formalized in the language of classical first order logic FOL by selecting a two place predicate of rewriting it as and adopting the universal closures of the following two postulates Ref LL where the formula is like the formula except for having occurrences of at some or all of the places has occurrences of see Enderton for a precise definition Ref is the principle of the reflexivity of identity and LL Leibniz Law is the principle of the indiscernibility of identicals It says in effect that identical objects cannot differ in any respect The other characteristic properties of identity symmetry and transitivity may be deduced from Ref and LL Any relation that is reflexive transitive and symmetric is called an equivalence relation Thus identity is an equivalence relation satisfying LL But not all equivalence relations satisfy LL For example the relation and are the same size is an equivalence relation that does not satisfy LL with respect to a rich language such as English Let be an equivalence relation defined on a set A For in A is the set of all in A such that this is the equivalence class of determined by The equivalence relation divides the set A into mutually exclusive equivalence classes whose union is A The family of such equivalence classes is called the partition of A induced by Now let A be a set and define the relation I A as follows For and in A I A if and only if for each subset of A either and are both elements of or neither is an element of This definition is equivalent to the more usual one identifying the identity relation on a set A with the set of ordered pairs of the form for in A The present definition proves more helpful in what follows Suppose for the moment that we do not assign any special interpretation to the identity symbol We treat it like any other two place predicate Let be a structure for and assume that Ref and LL are true in Call the relation defined in by the conjunction of Ref and LL indiscernibility see Enderton for the definition of definability in a structure There are three important points to note about the relationship between indiscernibility and the relation I A First indiscernibility need not be the relation I A where A is the domain of the structure It might be an equivalence relation having the property that for some elements of the domain holds although I A fails Secondly there is no way to correct for this possibility There is no sentence or set of sentences that could be added to the list beginning with Ref and LL that would guarantee that indiscernibility coincides with I A This fact is usually expressed by saying that identity is not a first order or elementary relation For a proof see Hodges However in a language such as set theory as usually interpreted or second order logic in which there is a quantifier all permitting quantification over all subsets of a given set I A is definable Third given any structure for in which Ref and LL are true there is a corresponding structure QM the quotient structure determined by in which indiscernibility does coincide with I A QM is obtained in roughly the following way Let the elements of QM be the equivalence classes for elements of determined by indiscernibility in If is a one place predicate true in of some object in then define to be true of in QM and similarly for many place predicates and constants It can then be shown that any sentence true in is true in QM and vice versa The existence of quotient structures makes it possible to treat the identity symbol as a logical constant interpreted in terms of I A There is in fact in general no other way to guarantee that Ref and LL will hold in every structure As Quine points out however a finite language will always contain a predicate satisfying Ref and LL in any structure cf Hodges The alternative however is to view FOL with Ref and LL FOL as a proper theory in whose models structures in which Ref and LL hold there will be an equivalence relation such that if holds then and will be indiscernible with respect to the defined subsets of the domain But we cannot in general assume that every subset of the domain is definable If the domain is infinite runs out of defining formulas long before the domain runs out of subsets Nonetheless a strong metatheorem asserts that any set of formulas that has a model has a countable finite or denumerable model This means that the difference between indiscernibility and I A is minimized at least to the extent that for a sufficiently rich language such as the valid formulas concerning indiscernibility the formulas true in every model of what is termed below the pure theory with identity coincide with the valid formulas concerning I A See Epstein for a sketch of a proof of this fact This is not to say however that there isn a significant difference between identity qua indiscernibility and identity qua I A see below Both points of view that FOL is a proper theory and that it is a logic may be found in the literature Quine The latter is the more usual view and it will count here as part of the standard account of identity Assume that is some fragment of containing a subset of the predicate symbols of and the identity symbol Let be a structure for and suppose that some identity statement a where a and are individual constants is true in and that Ref and LL are true in Now expand to a structure for a richer language perhaps itself That is assume we add some predicates to and interpret them as usual in to obtain an expansion of Assume that Ref and LL are true in and that the interpretation of the terms a and remains the same Is a true in That depends If the identity symbol is treated as a logical constant the answer is yes But if it is treated as a non logical symbol then it can happen that a is false in The indiscernibility relation defined by the identity symbol in may differ from the one it defines in and in particular the latter may be more fine grained than the former In this sense if identity is treated as a logical constant identity is not language relative whereas if identity is treated as a non logical notion it is language relative For this reason we can say that treated as a logical constant identity is unrestricted For example let be a fragment of containing only the identity symbol and a single one place predicate symbol and suppose that the identity symbol is treated as non logical The formula is then true in any structure for in which Ref and LL are true The reason is that the unique one place predicate of divides the domain of a structure into those objects it satisfies and those it does not Hence at least two of any group of three objects will be indiscernible On the other hand if the identity symbol is interpreted as I A this formula is false in any structure for with three or more elements If we do wish to view identity as a non logical notion then the phenomenon of language relativity suggests that it is best not to formalize identity using a single identity predicate Instead we have the following picture We begin with a language and define an theory with identity to be a theory whose logical axioms are those of FOL and which is such that contains a two place predicate EL satisfying the non logical axiom Ref and the non logical axiom schema LL Ref EL LL EL The pure theory with identity is the theory whose sole non logical axiom is Ref and whose sole non logical axiom schema is LL Now the phenomenon of language relativity can be described more accurately as follows Let be a sublanguage of and assume that and are respectively the pure theory with identity and the pure theory with identity Let and be models of and respectively having the same domain Assume that a and are individual constants having the same interpretation in and Let and be the identity symbols of and It can happen that a is true in but a is false in We can then say with Geach see and others that the self same objects indiscernible according to one theory may be discernible according to another There are two further philosophically significant features of the standard account of identity First identity is a necessary relation If a and are rigid terms terms whose reference does not vary with respect to parameters such as time or possible world then NI If a is true then it is necessarily true Assuming certain modal principles the necessity of distinctness ND follows from NI ND If a is true then it is necessarily true Note that the necessary truth of a does not imply the necessary existence of objects a or We may assume that what a rigid term a denotes at a possible world or moment of time need not exist in Secondly we do not ordinarily say things of the form is the same as Instead we say and are the same person or and are the same book The standard view is that the identity component of such statements is just is the same as For example according to the standard view and are the same person reduces to and are persons and is the same as where the second conjunct may be formalized as in FOL Paradoxes of Identity The concept of identity simple and settled though it may seem as characterized by the standard account gives rise to a great deal of philosophical perplexity A few by no means all of the salient problems are outlined below These are presented in the form of paradoxes arguments from apparently undeniable premises to obviously unacceptable conclusions The aim here is to make clear just what options are available to one who would stick close to the standard account Often but not always little or no defense or critique of any particular option is offered In the next section we shall see what the relative identity alternative offers by comparison The Paradox of Change The most fundamental puzzle about identity is the problem of change Suppose we have two photographs of a dog Oscar In one A Oscar is a puppy in the other he is old and gray muzzled Yet we hold that he is the same dog in it appears direct violation of LL More explicitly is a photograph of an old dog with a gray muzzle A is a photograph of a young dog without a gray muzzle A and are photographs of the same dog But according to LL if the dog in has a property having a gray muzzle that the dog in A lacks then A and are not photographs of the same dog Contradiction Various solutions have been proposed The most popular are the following two Simple properties such as having or lacking a gray muzzle are actually relations to times Oscar has the property of lacking a gray muzzle at time and the property of having a gray muzzle at a later but there is no incompatibility since being thus and so related to time and not being thus and so related to time are compatible conditions and hence change involves no violation of LL Oscar is an object that is extended in time as well as space The puppy Oscar and old gray muzzled Oscar are distinct temporal parts or stages of the whole temporally extended Oscar The photograph of Oscar as a puppy is therefore not a photograph of Oscar at all There cannot be still photographs of Oscar These proposals may seem plausible and indeed most philosophers subscribe to one or other of them The most common objections that on the temporal parts account objects are not wholly present at any given time and that on the relations to times account seemingly simply properties of objects such as Oscar having a gray muzzle are complicated relations do little more than affirm what their targets deny Yet the objections are an attempt to give voice to a strong intuition concerning our experience as creatures existing in time Both and treat time and change from a God eye point of view presupposes time laid out all at once so to speak and similarly for But we experience no such thing Instead while we are prepared to wait to see the whole of a baseball game we are watching we are not prepared to wait to see the whole of painting we are viewing Chrysippus Paradox The following paradox a variation of the paradox of change raises some new questions It is due to the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus and has recently been resurrected by Michael Burke Burke Suppose that at some point in the future poor Oscar loses his tail Consider the proper part of Oscar as he is now at consisting of the whole of Oscar minus his tail Call this object Oscar minus Chrysippus wished to know which of these objects Oscar or Oscar minus survives at According to the standard account of identity Oscar and Oscar minus are distinct at and hence by ND they are distinct at Intuitively Oscar and Oscar minus are distinct at since Oscar has a property at that Oscar minus lacks namely the property of having had a tail at Notice that this argument involves a tacit appeal to ND or NI depending on how you look at it Hence if both survive we have a case of two distinct physical objects occupying exactly the same space at the same time Assuming that is impossible and assuming as commonsense demands that Oscar survives the loss of his tail it follows that Oscar minus does not survive This conclusion is paradoxical because it appears that nothing happens to Oscar minus in the interval between and that would cause it to perish One extreme option is to deny that there are such things as Oscar minus Undetached proper parts of objects don exist van Inwagen Another is to claim that the parts of an object are essential to it Chisholm A third less extreme option is to insist that objects of different kinds a clay statue and the piece of clay it is composed of can occupy the same space at the same time but objects of the same kind two statues cannot Wiggins for refinements see Oderberg A fourth option is to claim that Oscar and Oscar minus are two distinct temporally extended objects a dog part Oscar minus and a dog Oscar that overlap at Temporal parts of distinct objects can occupy the same space at the same time The Paradox of Dalmatians This paradox is also known as the paradox of cats Geach Lewis Focus on Oscar and Oscar minus at before Oscar loses his tail Is Oscar minus a dog When Oscar loses his tail the resulting creature is certainly a dog Why then should we deny that Oscar minus is a dog We saw above that one possible response to Chrysippus paradox was to claim that Oscar minus does not exist at But even if we adopt this view how does it follow that Oscar minus existing as it does at is not a dog Yet if Oscar minus is a dog then given the standard account of identity there are two dogs where we would normally count only one In fact for each of Oscar hairs of which there are at least there is a proper part of Oscar Oscar minus a hair which is just as much a dog as Oscar minus There are then at least dogs and in fact many more where we would count only one Some claim that things such as dogs are maximal No proper part of a dog is a dog Burke One might conclude as much simply to avoid multiplying the number of dogs populating the space reserved for Oscar alone But the maximality principle may seem to be independently justified as well When Oscar barks do all these different dogs bark in unison If a thing is a dog shouldn it be capable of independent action Yet Oscar minus cannot act independently of Oscar Nevertheless David Lewis has suggested a reason for counting Oscar minus and all the dog parts that differ in various different ways from one another and Oscar by a hair as dogs and in fact as Dalmatians Oscar is a Dalmatian Lewis invokes Unger problem of the many Oscar sheds continuously but gradually His hairs loosen and then dislodge some such remaining still in place Hence within Oscar compass at any given time there are congeries of Dalmatian parts sooner or later to become definitely Dalmatians some in a day some in a second or a split second It seems arbitrary to proclaim a Dalmatian part that is a split second away from becoming definitely a Dalmatian a Dalmatian while denying that one a day away is a Dalmatian As Lewis puts it we must either deny that the many are Dalmatians or we must deny that the Dalmatians are many Lewis endorses proposals of both types but seems to favor one of the latter type according to which the Dalmatians are not many but rather almost one In any case the standard account of identity seems unable on its own to handle the paradox of Dalmatians It requires that we either deny that Oscar minus a hair is a dog and a Dalmatian or else that we must affirm that there is a multiplicity of Dalmatians all but one of which is incapable of independent action and all of which bark in unison no more loudly than Oscar barks alone The Paradox of Constitution Suppose that on day Jones purchases a piece of clay and fashions it into a statue On day Jones destroys but not by squeezing into a ball and fashions a new statue out of On day Jones removes a part of discards it and replaces it using a new piece of clay thereby destroying and replacing it by a new piece of clay Presumably survives this change Now what is the relationship between the pieces of clay and the statues they constitute A natural answer is identity On day is identical to and on day is identical to On day is identical to But this conclusion directly contradicts NI If on day is identical to then it follows given NI that on day is since is identical to on day and hence that exists on day which it does not By a similar argument on day is since is identical to both and so exists on day which it does not We might conclude then that either constitution is not identity or that NI is false Neither conclusion is wholly welcome Once we adopt the standard account less NI the latter principle follows directly from the assumption that individual variables and constants in quantified modal logic are to be handled exactly as they are in first order logic And if constitution is not identity and yet statues as well as pieces of clay are physical objects and what else would they be then we are again forced to affirm that distinct physical objects may occupy exactly the same space at the same time The statue and the piece of clay occupy the same space on day Even if this is deemed possible Wiggins it is unparsimonious The standard account is thus prima facie incompatible with the natural idea that constitution is identity Philosophers have not argued by direct appeal to NI or ND Typically Gibbard Noonan Johnston arguments that and are not identical run as follows exists prior to the existence of and hence the two are not identical Again possesses the property of being such that it will be destroyed by being squeezed into a ball but does not possess this property will be squeezed into a ball but it will not thereby be destroyed So again the two are not identical Further whatever the future in fact brings might have been squeezed into a ball and not destroyed Since that is not true of the two are not identical On a careful analysis however each of these arguments can be seen to rely on NI or ND provided one adopts the standard account of modal temporal predicates This last proviso suggests an interesting way out for one who adheres to the standard account of identity but who also holds that constitution is identity see below Some philosophers find it important or at least expedient to frame the issue in terms of the case of a statue and piece of clay that coincide throughout their entire existence We bring both and into existence by joining two other pieces of clay together or we do something else that guarantees total coincidence It seems that total coincidence is supposed to lend plausibility to the claim that in such a case at least constitution is identity and hence NI is false Gibbard It may do so psychologically but not logically The same sorts of arguments against the thesis that constitution is identity apply in such a case For example may be admired for its aesthetic traits even long after it ceases to exist but this need not be true of And has the property which lacks of being destroyed if squeezed into a ball Those who defend the thesis that constitution is identity need to defend it in the general case of partial coincidence and those who attack the thesis do so with arguments that work equal well against both total and partial coincidence The assumption that and are totally coincident is therefore inessential The doctrine of temporal parts offers only limited help The statement that is identical to day but identical to on day can be construed to mean that is a temporally extended object whose day stage is identical to and whose day stage is identical to Since the two stages are not identical NI does not apply Similarly we can regard as a temporally extended object that overlaps on day and on day But unless temporal parts theorists are prepared to defend a doctrine of modally extended objects objects extended through possible worlds analogous to objects extended in time there remains a problem might have been made of a different piece of clay as is in fact the case on day That is it is logically possible for to fail to coincide with the day stage of But it is not logically possible for the day stage of to fail to coincide with itself Lewis recognizes this difficulty and proposes to deal with it by appealing to his counterpart theory Lewis and Different concepts statue and piece of clay are associated with different counterpart relations and hence with different criteria of trans world identity This has the effect of rendering modal predicates Abelardian Noonan The property determined by a modal predicate may be affected by the subject term of a sentence containing the predicate The subject term denotes an object belonging to this or that kind or sort But different kinds or sorts may determine different properties or different counterpart relations In particular the properties determined by the predicate might not have coincided with where names the day stage of in the following sentences a might not have coincided with might not have coincided with are different and hence a and are compatible even assuming that and are identical It should be emphasized that counterpart theory is not the only means of obtaining Abelardian predicates See Noonan The upshot seems to be that that the advocate of the standard account of identity must maintain either that constitution is not identity or that modal predicates are Abelardian The latter option may be the fruitful one since for one thing it seems to have applications that go beyond the issue of constitution The Ship of Theseus Paradox See Plutarch Life of Theseus Imagine a wooden ship restored by replacing all its planks and beams and other parts by new ones Plutarch reports that such a ship was a model for the philosophers with respect to the disputed arguments some of them saying it remained the same some of them saying it did not remain the same cf Rea Hobbes added the catch that the old parts are reassembled to create another ship exactly like the original Both the restored ship and the reassembled one appear to qualify equally to be the original In the one case the original is remodeled in the other it is reassembled Yet the two resulting ships are clearly not the same ship Some have proposed that in a case like this our ordinary criteria of identity fail us The process of dismantling and reassembling usually preserves identity as does the process of part replacement otherwise no soldier could be issued just one rifle and body shops would function as manufacturers But in this case the two processes produce conflicting results We get two ships one of which is the same ship as the original by one set of criteria and the other is the original ship by another set of criteria There is a similar conflict of criteria in the case of personal identity Brain duplication scenarios Wiggins Parfit suggest that it is logically possible for one person to split into two competitors each with equal claim to be the original person We take it for granted that brain duplication will preserve the psychological properties normally relevant to reidentifying persons and we also take it for granted that the original brain continues to embody these properties even after it is duplicated In this sense there is a conflict of criteria Such a case of fission gives us two distinct embodiments of these properties Perhaps we should conclude that identity is not what matters Instead what matters is some other relation but one that accounts as readily as identity for such facts as that the owner of the original ship would be entitled to both the restored version and the reassembled one For the case of personal identity Parfit develops such a response in detail A related reaction would be to claim that if both competitors have equal claim to be the original then neither is the original If however one competitor is inferior then the other wins the day and counts as the original It seems that on this view certain contingencies can establish or falsify identity claims That conflicts with NI Suppose that is a possible world in which no ship is assembled from the discarded parts of the remodeled ship In this world then the remodeled ship is the original By NI the restored ship and the original are identical in the actual world contrary to the claim of the best candidate doctrine which says that neither the remodeled nor the reassembled ship is the original There are however more sophisticated best candidate theories that are not vulnerable to this objection Nozick Some are convinced that the remodeled ship has the best claim to be the original since it exhibits a greater degree of spatio temporal continuity with the original Wiggins But it is unclear why the intuition that identity is preserved by spatio temporal continuity should take precedence over the intuition that identity is preserved in the process of dismantlement and reassembly Furthermore certain versions of the ship of Theseus problem do not involve the feature that one of the ships competing to be the original possesses a greater degree of spatio temporal continuity with the original than does the other see below Others are equally convinced that identity is not preserved by total part replacement This view is often suggested blindly as a stab in the dark but there is in fact an interesting argument in its favor Kripke argues that a table made out of a particular hunk of wood could not have been made out of a totally different hunk of wood His reasoning is this Suppose that in the actual world a table is made out of a hunk of wood and suppose that there is a possible world in which this very table is made out of a different hunk of wood Then assuming that and are completely unrelated for example they do not overlap so that making a table out of the one is not somehow dependent upon making a table out of the other there is another possible world in which as in the actual world is made out of and another table exactly similar to is made out of Since and are not identical in it follows by ND that the table made out of in is not Note however that the argument assumes that the table made out of in is the same table as the table made out of in Kripke reasoning can be applied to the present case Kripke and others might dispute this claim see below Let be a possible world just like the actual world in that the original ship is manufactured exactly as it is in the actual world In however another ship exactly similar to is simultaneously built out of precisely the same parts that the remodeled ship is built out of in the actual world Since and are clearly different ships in it follows by ND that and are not the same ship in the actual world Note again that the argument assumes that and are the same ship but it seems quite a stretch to deny that Nevertheless some have done so Carter claims in effect that and are not identical but his argument simply assumes that and are the same ship Alternatively one might view the Kripkean argument as showing only that while is the same ship as in the actual world that is is not the same ship as in But this is not an option for one who adheres to the standard account and hence adheres to ND In defending this view however Gallois suggests a weakened notion of rigid designation and a corresponding weakened formulation of ND See Carter for criticism of Gallois proposals See also Chandler for a precursor of Gallois argument If we grant that and cannot be the same ship we seem to have a solution to the ship of Theseus paradox By the Kripkean argument only the reassembled ship has any claim to being the original ship But this success is short lived For we are left with the following additional paradox Suppose that eventuates from by replacing one part of one day at a time There seems to be widespread agreement that replacing just one part of a thing by a new exactly similar part preserves the identity of the thing If so then by the transitivity of identity and must be the same ship It follows that either the Kripkean argument is incorrect or replacement of even a single part or small portion does not preserve identity a view known as mereological essentialism Chisholm As indicated Kripke denies that his argument for the necessity of origin applies to the case of change over time The question whether the table could have changed into ice is irrelevant here So the question whether could change into is supposedly irrelevant But Kripke does not give a reason for this claim and if cases of trans temporal identity and trans world identity differ markedly in relevant respects repsects relevant to Kripke argument for the necessity of origin it is not obvious what they are But see Forbes and Lewis for discussion The argument above was simply that and cannot be the same ship since there is a possible world in which they differ If this argument is incorrect it is no doubt because there are conclusive reasons showing that and differ Even so such reasons are clearly not irrelevant One may suspect that if applied to the trans temporal case Kripke reasoning will yield an argument for mereological essentialism Indeed a trans world counterpart of such an argument has been tried Chandler though Chandler views his argument somewhat differently In its effect this argument does not differ essentially from the paradox sketched in the previous paragraph which may well be viewed as an argument for mereological essentialism Subsequent commentators Salmon and Chandler do not seem to take Kripke admonition of irrelevance seriously In any case there is a close connection between the two issues the ship of Theseus problem and the question of the necessity of origin This can be seen though it may already be clear by considering a modified version of the ship of Theseus problem Suppose that when is built another ship exactly like is also built Suppose that never sets sail but instead is used as a kind of graphic repair manual and parts repository for Over time planks are removed from and used to replace corresponding planks of The result is a ship made wholly of planks from and standing in the end we may suppose in exactly the place has always stood Now do and have equal claim to be And can we then declare that neither is Not according to the Kripkean line of thought It looks for all the world as though the process of remodeling is really just an elaborate means of dismantling and reassembling And if and are the same ship then since and are distinct and cannot be the same ship This argument is vulnerable to the following two important criticisms First it conflicts with the common sense principle that the material of an object can be totally replenished or replaced without affecting its identity Salmon and secondly as mentioned it conflicts with the additional common sense principle that replacement by a single part or small portion preserves identity These objections may seem to provide sufficient grounds for rejecting the Kripkean argument and perhaps restricting the application of Kripke original argument for the necessity of origin Noonan There is however a rather striking problem with and it is uncleear whether the conflict between and the Kripkean argument should be resolved in favor of the former The problem with is this Pick a simple sort of objects say shoes or better sandals Suppose A and are two exactly similar sandals one of which A is brand new and the other is worn out Each consists of a top strap and a sole nothing more If worn strap is replaced by A new one dictates that the resulting sandal is refurbished In fact if the parts of A and are simply exchanged dictates that that the sandal with the new parts A is and the sandal with the old parts is A It follows by ND that A and A and and are distinct This is surely the wrong result The intuition that A and A are the same sandal is very strong and the process of exchanging the parts of A and seems to amount to nothing more than the dismantling and reassembling of each This example is no different in principle than the more elaborate trans world cases discussed by Chisholm Chandler Salmon or Gupta One who claims that A and A differ in that A comes into existence after A does not have much to go on A cannot be supposed to persist after A comes into existence We do not end up with two new sandals and one old one Why then couldn it be A itself that reappears at the later time Church Paradox The following paradox perhaps the ultimate paradox of identity derives from an argument of Church Suppose Pierre thinks that London and Londres are different cities but of course doesn think that London is different from London or that Londres is different from Londres Assuming that proper names lack Fregean senses we can apply LL to get the result that London and Londres are distinct We have here an argument that given the standard account of identity merely thinking that and are distinct is enough to make them so There are of course a number of ways around this conclusion without abandoning the standard account of identity Church himself saw the argument his version of it as demonstrating the inadequacy of Russellian intensional logic in which variables and constants operate as they do in extensional logic unequipped with senses For another reaction see Salmon But there are strong arguments against the view that names or variables have senses Kripke In light of these arguments Church argument may be viewed as posing yet another paradox of identity The general form of Church argument has been exploited by others to reach further puzzling conclusions For example it has been used to show that there can be no such thing as vague or indeterminate identity Evans and for discussion Parsons For is not vaguely identical to hence if is assumed to be vaguely identical to then by LL and are absolutely distinct As it stands Evans argument shows at best that vaguely identical objects must be absolutely distinct not that there is no such thing as vague identity But some have tried to amend the argument to get Evans conclusion Parsons and see the entry on vagueness In any case it is useful to see the connection between Evans argument and Church If for example vaguely identical is taken to mean thought to be identical then the two arguments collapse into one another Church line of argument would seem to lead ultimately to the extreme antirealist position that any perceived difference among objects is a real difference If one resolves not to attempt to escape the clutches of LL by some clever dodge by disallowing straightforward quantifying in for example as with the doctrine of Abelardian predicates one comes quickly to the absurd conclusion that no statement of the form where the terms are different or are just different tokens of the same type can be true Yet it might just be that the fault lies not in ourselves but in LL Relative Identity The fundamental claim of relative identity the claim the various versions of the idea have in common is that as it seems in the passenger person case it can and does happen that and are the same and yet and are not the same Now it is usually supposed that if and are the same etc then that implies that and are Fs Gs etc If so then the above schema is trivially satisfied by the case in which and are the same person but is not a passenger at all But let us resolve to use the phrase and are different Gs to mean and are Gs and and are not the same Then the nontrivial core claim about relative identity is that the following may well be true RI and are the same but and are different Gs RI is a very interesting thesis It seems to yield dramatically simple solutions to at least some of the puzzles about identity We appear to be in a position to assert that young Oscar and old Oscar are the same dog but nonetheless distinct temporary objects that Oscar and Oscar minus are the same dog but different dog parts that the same piece of clay can be now identical to one statue and now another that London and Londres are the same city but different objects of thought and so forth Doubts develop quickly however Either the same dog relation satisfies LL or it does not If it does not it is unclear why it should be taken to be a relation of identity But if it satisfies LL then it follows given that Oscar and Oscar minus are different dog parts that Oscar minus is not the same dog part as Oscar minus Furthermore assuming that the same dog part relation is reflexive it follows from the assumption that Oscar minus and Oscar minus are the same dog and that LL is in force that Oscar and Oscar minus are indeed the same dog part which in fact they are not It may seem then that RI is simply incoherent These arguments however are a bit too quick On analysis they show only that the following three conditions form an inconsistent triad RI is true for some fixed predicates and Identity relations are equivalence relations The relation and are the same figuring in satisfies LL For suppose that the relation and are the same figuring in is reflexive and that is a Then is the same as But according to and are not the same Gs hence according to it is not the case that and are the same yet asserts otherwise Now most relative identity theorists maintain that while identity relations are equivalence relations they do not in general satisfy LL However according to at least one analysis of the passenger person case and others the same person relation satisfies LL but the same passenger relation is not straightforwardly an equivalence relation Gupta It should be clear though that this view is incompatible with the principle of the identity of indiscernibles If and are different passengers there must be by the latter principle some property possesses that does not Hence if the same person relation satisfies LL it follows that and are not the same person For the remainder we will assume that identity relations are equivalence relations Given this assumption and assuming that the underlying propositional logic is classical cf Parsons RI and LL are incompatible in the sense that within the framework of a single fixed language for which LL is defined RI and LL are incompatible Yet the advocate of relative identity cannot simply reject any form of LL There are true and indispensable instances of LL If and are the same dog then surely if is a Dalmatian so is The problem is that of formulating and motivating restricted forms of LL that are nonetheless strong enough to bear the burden of identity claims There has been little systematic work done in this direction crucial though it is to the relative identity project See Deutsch for discussion of this issue There are however equivalence relations that do satisfy restricted forms of LL These are sometimes called congruence relations and they turn up frequently in mathematics For example say that integers and are congruent if their difference is a multiple of This relation preserves multiplication and addition but not every property The numbers and are thus congruent but is even and is not There are also non mathematical congruencies For example the relation and are traveling at the same speed preserves certain properties and not others If objects and are traveling at the same speed and is traveling faster than the same is true of Such similarity relations satisfy restricted forms of LL In fact any equivalence relation satisfies a certain minimal form of LL see below There are strong and weak versions of RI The weak version says that RI has some in fact many true instances but also that there are predicates such that if and are the same then for any equivalence relation whatsoever whether or not an identity relation This last condition implies that the relation and are the same satisfies LL The relation defined so that if and only if and where is some predicate is an equivalence relation Hence if holds of but not of there is an equivalence relation namely that fails to hold of and If we add that in this instance and are the same is to be interpreted in terms of the relation I A then the weak version of RI says that there is such a thing as relative identity and such a thing as absolute identity as well The strong version by contrast says that there are many true instances of RI but there is no such thing as absolute identity It is difficult to know what to make of the latter claim Taken literally it is false The notion of unrestricted identity in the sense of unrestricted explained in is demonstrably coherent We return to this matter in The puzzles about identity outlined in and there are many others as well as many variants of these put considerable pressure on the standard account A theory of identity that allows for instances of RI is an attractive alternative see below But there is a certain kind of example of RI frequently discussed in the literature that has given relative identity something of a bad name The passenger person example is a case in point The noun passenger is derived from the corresponding relational expression passenger in on A passenger is someone who is a passenger in some vehicle on some flight etc Similarly a father is man who fathers someone or who is the father of someone This way of defining a kind of things from a relation between things is perfectly legitimate and altogether open ended Given any relation we can define an to apply to anything that stands in to something For example we can define a schmapple to be an apple in a barrel All this is fine But we can infer from such a definition that the same apple might be two different schmapples From the fact that someone is the father of two different children we don judge that he is two different fathers The fact that airlines choose to count passengers as they do rather than track persons is their business not logic However when is an equivalence relation we are entitled to such an inference Consider the notorious case of surmen Geach A pair of men are the same surman if they have the same surname and a surman is a man who bears this relation to someone So now it appears that that two different men can be the same surman since two different men can have the same surname As Geach insists also Geach surmen are defined to be men so they are not merely classes of men Hence we seem to have an instance of RI and obviously any similarity relation and have the same shape will give rise to a similar case Yet such instances of RI are not very interesting It is granted all around that when is adjectival different Gs may be the same Different men may have the same surname different objects the same color etc Turning an adjectival similarity relation into a substantival one having the form of an identity statement yields an identity statement in name only A word about the point of view of those who subscribe to the weak version of RI The view call it the weak view is that ordinary identity relations concerning largely the world of contingency and change are equivalence relations answering to restricted forms of LL The exact nature of the restriction depends on the equivalence relation itself though there is an element of generality The kinds of properties preserved by the same dog relation are intuitively the same kinds of properties as are preserved by the same cat relation From a logical point of view the best that can be said is that any identity relation like any equivalence relation preserves a certain minimal set of properties For suppose is some equivalence relation Let be the set containing all formulas of the form and closed under the formation of negations conjunctions and quantification Then preserves any property expressed by a formula in Furthermore on this view although absolutely distinct objects may be the same absolutely identical objects cannot differ at all Any instance of RI implies that and are absolutely distinct The Paradoxes Reconsidered Let us look back at the paradoxes of identity outlined in from the perspective of the weak view regarding relative identity That view allows that absolutely distinct objects may be the same but denies that absolutely identical objects can be different This implies that if and are relatively different objects then and are absolutely distinct and hence only pairs of absolutely distinct objects can satisfy RI If and are absolutely distinct we shall say that and are distinct logical objects and similarly if and are absolutely identical objects then and are identical logical objects The term logical object does not stand for some new and special kind of thing Absolutely distinct apples for example are distinct logical objects The following is the barest sketch of relativist solutions to the paradoxes of identity discussed in No attempt is made to fully justify any proposed solution though a modicum of justification emerges in the course of It should be kept in mind that some of the strength of the relativist solutions derives from the weaknesses of the absolutist alternatives some of which are discussed in The Paradox of Change Young Oscar and old Oscar are the same dog but absolutely different things different logical objects The material conditions rendering young Oscar and old Oscar the same dog and the same Dalmatian are precisely the same as the material conditions under which young Oscar and old Oscar would qualify as temporal parts of the same dog The only difference is logical The identity relation between young Oscar and old Oscar can be formalized in an extensional logic Deutsch but a theory of temporal parts requires a modal temporal apparatus Young Oscar is wholly present during his youth and possesses the simple non relational property of not having a gray muzzle Chrysippus Paradox Oscar and Oscar minus both survive Oscar loss of a tail At both and Oscar and Oscar minus are the same dog but at Oscar and Oscar minus are distinct logical objects This implies by ND that Oscar and Oscar minus are distinct logical objects even at Hence we must allow that distinct logical objects may occupy the same space at the same time This is not a problem however For although Oscar and Oscar minus are distinct logical objects at they are physically coincident The Paradox of Dalmatians The relativist denies that dogs are maximal It is not true that no proper part of a dog is dog All the and more proper parts of Oscar differing from him and from one another by a hair are dogs In fact many though of course not all identity preserving changes Oscar might undergo correspond directly to proper parts of an unchanged Oscar But there is no problem about barking in unison and no problem about acting independently All are the same dog despite their differences just as young Oscar and old Oscar are the same dog The relativist denies that the dogs are many rather than deny that the many are dogs Lewis The Paradox of Constitution Constitution is identity absolute identity The relation between the piece of clay and the statue on day is one of absolute identity So we have that on day and for the same reason on day Furthermore since and are different statues it follows on the weak view that In addition the piece of clay constituting on day is relatively the same piece of clay as the piece of clay constituting on day The identity is relative because we have distinct objects the two statues that are the same piece of clay It follows that no name of the piece of clay can be a rigid designator in the standard sense That is no name of denotes absolutely the same thing on day and on day For on day a name of the piece of clay would denote and on day it would denote and and are absolutely distinct Nevertheless a name of the piece of clay may be relatively rigid it may denote at each time the same piece of clay Although no name of the piece of clay is absolutely rigid that does not prevent the introduction of a name of that denotes at any time or possible world Kraut discusses a related notion of relative rigidity There is however a certain ambiguity in the notion of a name of the piece of clay inasmuch as the piece of clay may be any number of absolutely distinct objects The notion of relative rigidity presupposes that a name for the piece of clay refers with respect to some parameter to whatever object counts as the piece of clay relative to that parameter This may be sufficient in the case of the piece of clay but in other cases it is not With respect to a fixed parameter there may be no unique object to serve as the referent of the name For example if any number of dog parts count at a fixed time as the same dog then which of these objects serves as the referent of Oscar We shall leave this question open for the time being but suggest that it may be worthwhile to view names such as Oscar as instantial terms terms introduced into discourse by means of existential instantiation The name Oscar might be taken as denoting a representative member of the equivalence class of distinct objects qualifiying as the same dog as Oscar It would follow then that most ordinary names are instantial terms An alternative is that of Geach who draws a distinction between a name of and a name for an object see Noonan for discussion of Geach distinction The Ship of Theseus Paradox In this case the relativist as so far understood may seem to enjoy no advantage over the absolutist The problem is not clearly one of reconciling LL with ordinary judgments of identity and the advantage afforded by RI does not seem applicable Griffin for example relying on RI claims that the original and remodeled ship are the same ship but not the same collection of planks whereas the reassembled ship is the same collection of planks as the original but not the same ship This simply doesn resolve the problem The problem is that the reassembled and remodeled ships have prima facie equal claim to be the original and so the bald claims that the reassembled ship is not and the remodeled ship is the original are unsupported The problem is that of reconciling the intuition that certain small changes replacement of a single part or small portion preserve identity with the problem illustrated by the sandals example of It turns out nevertheless that the problem is one of dealing with the excesses of LL To resolve the problem we need an additional level of relativity To motivate this development consider the following abstract counterpart of the sandals example On the left there is an object composed of three parts and On the right is an exactly similar but non identical object composed of exactly similar parts and in exactly the same arrangement For the sake of illustration we adopt the rule that only replacement of at most a single part by an exactly similar part preserves identity Suppose we now interchange the parts of and We begin by replacing by in and replacing by in to obtain objects and So is composed of parts and and is composed of parts and We then replace in by to obtain and so on Given our sample criterion of identity and assuming the transitivity of identity and are counted the same as are and But this appears to be entirely the wrong result Intuitively and are the same as are and For and are composed of exactly the same parts put together in exactly the same way and similarly for and Futhermore can be viewed as simply the result of taking apart and putting it back together in a slightly different location And this last difference can be eliminated by switching the locations of and as a last step in the process Suppose however that we replace our criterion of identity by the following more complicated rule and are the same relative to if both and differ from at most by a single part This relation is transitive and is in fact an equivalence relation For example relative to and are the same but and are not Of course replacement by a single part is an artificial criterion of identity In actual cases it will be a matter of the degree or kind of deviation from the original represented by the third parameter The basic idea is that identity through change is not a matter of identity through successive accumulated changes that notion conflicts with both intuition the sandals example and the Kripkean argument Through successive changes objects can evolve into other objects The three place relation of idenitity does not satisfy LL and is consistent with the outlook of the relativist Gupta develops a somewhat similar idea in detail Williamson suggests a rather different approach but one that like the above treats identity through change as an equivalence relation that does not satisfy LL Church Paradox Church argument implies that if Pierre doxastic position is as described in then London and Londres are distinct objects Assuming the standard account of identity the result is that either Pierre doxastic position cannot be as described or else London and Londres are different cities or else we must punt Since London and Londres are not different cities the standard account entails that Pierre doxastic position cannot be as described or else we must punt This was Church own position as regards certain puzzles about synonymy such as Mate puzzle Mates Church held that one who believes that lawyers are lawyers must indeed believe that lawyers are attorneys despite any refusal to assent to or desire to dissent from Lawyers are attorneys Church Kripke later argued Kripke that assent and failure to assent must be taken at face value at least in the case of Pierre and Pierre doxastic position is as described Kripke chose to punt concluding that the problem is a problem for any logic of belief The relativist concludes instead that a Pierre doxastic position is as described if so London and Londres are distinct objects and London and Londres are nonetheless the same city Whether this resolution of Church paradox can be exploited to yield solutions to Frege puzzle Salmon or Kripke puzzle remains to be seen Crimmins has recently suggested that the analysis of propositional attitudes requires a notion of semantic pretense In reporting Pierre doxastic position we engage in a pretense to the effect that London and Londres are different cities associated with different Fregean senses Crimmins goal is to reconcile a and the following that the pure semantics of proper names London Londres is Millian or directly referential Kripke The relativist proposes just such a reconciliation but suggests that the pretense can be dropped Absolute Identity The philosopher Geach first broached the subject of relative identity and introduced the phrase relative identity Over the years Geach has suggested specific instances of RI a variant of the case of Oscar and his tail is due to Geach Geach and in this way he has contributed to the development of the weak view concerning relative identity the view that while ordinary identity relations are often relative some are not But Geach maintains that absolute identity does not exist What is his argument That is hard to say Geach sets up two strawman candidates for absolute identity one at the beginning of his discussion and one at the end and he easily disposes of both In between he develops an interesting and influential argument to the effect that identity even as formalized in the system FOL is relative identity However Geach takes himself to have shown by this argument that absolute identity does not exist At the end of his initial presentation of the argument in his paper Geach remarks We thought we had a criterion for a predicable expressing strict identity as Geach says strict absolute unqualified identity but the thing has come apart in our hands and no alternative rigorous criterion that could replace this one has thus far been suggested Geach It turns out as we ll see that all that comes apart is the false notion that in FOL the identity symbol defines the relation I A Let us examine Geach line of reasoning in detail focusing on the presentation in his article the locus classicus of the notion of relative identity Geach begins by urging that a plain identity statement and are the same is in need of a completing predicate and are the same Frege had argued that statements of number such as this is one require a completing predicate this is one and so it is Geach claims with identity statements This is a natural view for one who subscribes to RI The latter cannot even be stated without the completing predicates Nevertheless both the claim itself and the analogy with Frege have been questioned Some argue that the analogy with Frege is incorrect others that while the analogy is correct both Frege and Geach are wrong Perry and Bennett and Alston These matters will be discussed in greater detail in an updated version of this article They do not bear directly on the question of the coherence and truth of RI or the question of absolute identity One who adopts the weak view would not want to follow Geach on this score And one could maintain the completing thesis without being committed to RI Furthermore the completing thesis occupies a puzzling role in Geach dialectic Immediately following his statement of the thesis Geach formalizes FOL on the basis of the single formula a a The is for Hao Wang who first suggested it The reader is invited to prove Ref and LL from But we hear no complaint about the syntax of despite its involving a seemingly unrelativized identity symbol It turns out however that Geach apparently thinks of the completing predicate as being given by the whole descriptive apparatus of or a fragment thereof Geach now observes if we consider a moment we see that an I predicable in given theory need not express strict absolute unqualified identity it need mean no more than that two objects are indiscernible by the predicables that form the descriptive resources of the theory the ideology of the theory Here an I predicable is a binary relation symbol satisfying Geach focus at this point is on the need to relativize an I predicable to a theory Geach then immediately saddles the friend of absolute identity with the view that for real identity we need not bring in the ideology of a definite theory This is Geach first strawman When logicians in discussing FOL speak of real identity and they often do see Enderton or Silver for example they do not mean a relation of universal identity since the universal set does not exist Nor do they intend in formulating LL to use true of in a completely unrestrained way which gives rise to semantic paradox It is no argument against those who wish to distinguish mere indiscernibility from real identity to say that they will soon fall into contradictions Grelling or Russell The relation I A is sufficiently relativized It is relativized to a set A We come next to the main point Objects that are indiscernible when we are confined to the ideology of may perfectly well be discernible in ideology of a theory of which is a fragment The warrant for this claim can only be the language relativity of identity when treated as a non logical notion see That this is what Geach has in mind is clear from some approving remarks he makes in his article about Quine proposal to treat identity as a non logical notion But how does it follow that absolute identity does not exist Geach seems to think that the defender of absolute identity will look to Ref and LL or and not beyond for a full account of strict absolute unqualified identity That is not so The fact that these formulas in themselves define only indiscernibility relations is a logical commonplace So this is Geach second strawman Is Geach argument at least an argument that identity is relative Does language relativity support the conclusion that RI is true even of identity as formalized in FOL The general idea appears to be that language relativity suggests that we take identity to be indiscernibility and conclude that objects identical relative to one ideology may be different relative to another ideology and that this confirms RI Notice first of all that this argument relies on the identity of indiscernibles that indiscernibility implies identity This principle is not valid in FOL even when the latter is treated as a proper theory Language relativity does not imply that the distinctness of distinct objects cannot go unnoticed Secondly the interesting cases of RI do not involve a shift from an impoverished point of view to an improved one whether this is seen in epistemic terms which Geach disputes Geach or in purely logical terms We do not affirm that old Oscar and young Oscar for example are the same dog on the grounds that there is an ideology with respect to which old Oscar and young Oscar are indistinguishable Such an ideology would be incapable of describing any change in Oscar It is true that the same dog relation determines a set of predicates that do not discriminate between the members of certain pairs of dogs the dogs in the photographs mentioned in earlier for example And it is true that these predicates determine a sublanguage in which the same dog relation is a congruence no predicate of the sublanguage distinguishes from if and are the same dog But the very sense of such statements as that old Oscar and young Oscar are the same dog requires a language in which a change in Oscar is expressible We are talking after all about old Oscar and young Oscar If we take seriously the idea that change involves the application of incompatible predicates then the sublanguage cannot express the contrast between old Oscar and young Oscar Third the phenomenon of language relativity in the technical sense discussed in has led many philosophers including Geach to the view that ideology creates ontology There is no antecedently given domain of objects already individuated and waiting to be described Instead theories carve up the world in various ways rendering some things noticeably distinct and others indiscernible depending on a theories descriptive resources The very notion of object is theory bound Kraut This sort of anti realism may seem to go hand in hand with relative identity Model theory however is realist to its core and language relativity is a model theoretic phenomenon It is a matter of definability in a structure Referring back to in order to make sense of language relativity we have to start with a pair of distinct objects a and distinct from the standpoint of the metalanguage and hence a pair of objects we assume are already individuated These objects however are indistinguishable in since no formula of defines a subset of containing the one object and not the other When we move to we find that there is a formula of the enriched language that defines such a subset in Thus language relativity is not really any sort relativity of identity at all We must assume that the objects a and are distinct in order to describe the phenomenon If we are living in and suspect that Martians living in can distinguish a from our suspicion is not merely to the effect that Martians carve things up differently than we do Our own model theory tells us that there is more to it than that Our suspicion must be to the effect that a and are absolutely distinct If we are blind to the difference between a and but the Martians are not then there must be a difference and even if we are living in we know there a difference or at least we can suspect there is since model theory tells us that such suspicion is well founded Let us go back to Geach remark that we need not interpret identity absolutely While this is true we need not interpret it as indiscernibility either There are always the quotient structures Quine Instead of taking our reality to be and our identity to be indiscernibility in we can move to the quotient structure QM whose elements are the equivalence classes for in If and are indiscernible in then in QM and are absolutely identical We can do this even if we wish to treat FOL as a proper theory For example suppose is a language in which people having the same income are indiscernible The domain of now consists of people QM however consists of income groups equivalence classes of people having the same income and identity in QM is absolute Geach objects to such reinterpretation in terms of the quotient structures on the grounds that it increases the ontological commitments not only of but of any language of which is a sublanguage Let focus on first From a purely model theoretic point of view the question is moot We cannot deny that QM is a structure for Thus is committed to people vis vis one structure and to income groups vis vis the corresponding quotient structure But let pretend that the structures are representations of reality and so the question now becomes Which representation is preferable Is there then any reason to prefer the ontology of to that of QM contains people but no sets of people whereas QM contains sets of people but no people By Quine criterion of ontological commitment that to be is to be the value of a variable commitment to a set of objects does not carry a commitment to its elements That is one of the odd consequences of Quine criterion Unless there is some ontological reason to prefer people to sets of people perhaps because sets are never to be preferred the ontologies of and QM seem pretty much on a par Both commit to one kind of thing Geach makes the additional claim that the ontological commitments of a sublanguage of a language are inherited by Geach Suppose then that is a language containing expressions for several equivalence relations defined on people say same income same surname and same job Geach argues that need only be committed to the existence of people Things such as income groups job groups equivalence classes of people with the same job and surmen can all be counted using the equivalencies without bringing surmen job groups and income groups into the picture Consider any sublanguage for which any one of these equivalence relations is a congruence for which LL holds Pick the language for example in which people having the same job are indiscernible More precisely we assume that is the pure theory with identity whose ideology is confined to the language Let be a model of We may imagine the domain of to consist of people and we can interpret indiscernibility in to be the relation and have the same job Geach would argue that if is committed to the elements of the job groups then so is But that is not true If is a theory of the three distinct equivalence relations formulated in the most or would be committed to are the partitions determined by the equivalence relations and in any case it would be perfectly consistent to insist that whatever the ontological commitments of reality as described by consists of people The foregoing considerations are rather abstract To see more clearly what is at stake let us focus on a specific example Geach mentions that rational numbers are defined set theoretically to be equivalence classes of integers determined by a certain equivalence relation defined on fractions ordered pairs of integers is is etc He suggests that we can instead construe our theory of rational numbers to be about the fractions themselves taking the I predicable of our theory to be the following equivalence relation iff xv yu This approach Geach says would have the advantage of lightening a theory set theoretical burdens In our present example we need not bring in infinite sets of ordered pairs of integers into the theory of rationals The first thing to notice about this example is that cannot be the I predicable of such a theory since is defined in terms of identity look at the right side of It is that must serve as the I predicable and it renders distinct ordered pairs of integers discernible The moral is that not all equivalence relations can be drafted to do the job of identity even given a limited ideology There is indeed a plausible argument that any equivalence relation presupposes identity not necessarily in the direct way illustrated by but indirectly nonetheless see Moreover from the standpoint of general mathematics once we have we have the infinite equivalence classes it determines and the partition it induces These are inescapable Even from a more limited viewpoint it seems that once we have enough set theory to give us ordered pairs of integers and the ability to define we get the partition it induces as well Geach perceives an ontological advantage in relative identity but his argument is unconvincing Shifting to the quotient structures as Quine suggested does not induce a baroque Meinongian ontology Geach In particular the home language does not inherit the commitment of the fragment and the ontology of an arbitrary model of the pure theory of identity based on the latter language is at least no more various than that of the corresponding quotient model There are however a number of ways in which relative identity does succeed in avoiding commitment to certain entities required by its absolute rival These are discussed in the replies to objections and in the next section Objections and Replies The following constitute a start up set of objections and replies concerning relative identity and or aspects of the foregoing account of relative identity and its rival Time and space constraints prevent a more extended initial discussion In addition there is no presumption that the objections discussed below are the most important or that the initial replies to them are without fault It is hoped that the present discussion will evolve into a more full blown one involving contributions by the author and readers alike Should the discussion become lengthy old or unchallenged objections and or replies can be placed in the archives Objection Relativist theories of identity all of which are inconsistent with Leibniz principle LL currently enjoy little support The doubts about them are a whether they really are theories of numerical identity whether they can be made internally consistent and whether they are sufficiently motivated Burke Reply In reverse order The issues discussed in and surely provide sufficient motivation No proof of inconsistency has ever been forthcoming from opponents of relative identity and in fact the weak view is consistent inasmuch as it has a model in the theory of similarity relations The arguments outlined in the second paragraph of are frequently cited as showing that relative identity is incoherent but they show only that RI is incompatible with unrestricted LL a See the replies to objections and below Objection If an identity relation obeys only a restricted form of LL if it preserves only some properties and not all then how do we tell which properties serve to individuate a pair of distinct objects Reply Similarity relations satisfy only restricted forms of LL How then do we tell which properties are preserved by the same shape relation and which are not It is no objection to the thesis that identity relations in general preserve some properties and not others to demand to know which are which At best the objection points to a problem we must face anyway for the case of similarity In general a property is preserved by an equivalence relation if it spreads in an equivalence class determined by the relation If one member of the class has the property then every member does Every property spreads in a singleton as absolute identity demands Objection If identity statements are mere equivalencies what distinguishes identity from mere similarity Reply The distinction between identity and similarity statements or sentences is usually drawn in terms of the distinction between substantival and adjectival common nouns If is a common noun standing for a kind of things horse then and are the same is a statement of identity whereas if is an a common noun standing for a kind of properties of things then and are the same is a statement of similarity It interesting to note that when the noun is proper a proper name the result is a statement of similarity not identity as in He not the same Bill we knew before This distinction rests ultimately on the metaphysical distinction between substance and attribute object and property While the distinction no doubt presupposes the concept of individuation the bundle theory for example presupposes that we have the means to individuate properties there is no obvious reason to suppose that it entails the denial of RI the claim that no instance of RI is true For a beginner review from an historical perspective of the issues concerning substance and attribute see Connor and for more recent and advanced discussion and bibliography see the entry on properties Objection Consider the following alleged instance of RI A is the same word type as but A and are different word tokens If A and refer to the same objects throughout the first conjunct of is not an identity statement and the counterexample to the thesis that no instance of RI is true fails If both conjuncts are identity statements in the required sense A and must refer to word types in the first conjunct and word tokens in the second and the counterexample fails Perry Reply First if in the required sense means satisfies LL then the objection buys correctness only at the price of begging the question Advocates of relative identity will maintain that the relation A is the same word type as is an identity relation defined on tokens that does not satisfy LL Secondly even if one insists that in this case intuition dictates that if A and refer to tokens in both conjuncts of then A is the same word type as expresses only the similarity relation A and are tokens of the same type there are other cases where intuitively both conjuncts of RI involve identity relations and yet the relevant terms all refer to the same kind of things for example A and are the same dog but A and are different physical objects as said of young Oscar and old Oscar Here there is no temptation to suppose that the relation A and are the same dog is not an identity relation One may invoke a theory a theory of temporal parts for example that construes the relation as a certain kind of similarity but that is theory not pretheoretical intuition It is no objection to the relativist theory which holds in part that A and are the same dog expresses a relation of primitive identity that there is an alternative theory according to which it expresses a similarity relation obtaining between two temporal parts of the same object Furthermore in the case of A and refer again intuitively to the same things in both conjuncts Third there are cases in which the relative identity view does possess an ontological advantage Consider A and are the same piece of clay but A and are different statues Suppose A and are understood to refer to one sort of thing pieces of clay in the first conjunct and another statues in the second conjunct Assume that the piece of clay denoted by A in the first conjunct constitutes at time the statue Then assuming that statues are physical objects there are two distinct physical objects belonging to different kinds occupying the same space at Some notably Wiggins hold that this is entirely possible Distinct physical objects may occupy the same space at the same time provided they belong to different kinds The temporal parts doctrine supports and encourages this view A statue may be a temporal part of a temporally extended piece of clay But one statue it seems cannot be a temporal part of another Even so however the duality of constituter and thing constituted is unparsimonious cf Lewis and the relativist is not committed to it Again consider A and are the same book but A and are different copies of the book One can say that in the first conjunct A and refer to books absolutely the same book whereas in the second conjunct A and refer to absolutely distinct copies But the alleged duality of books and copies of books is unparsimonious and the relativist is not committed to it There is no reason to concede to the philosopher that we do not actually purchase or read books instead we purchase and read only copies of books Any copy of a book is just as much the book itself as is any other copy Any copy of a book is the same book as any other copy Nelson Goodman once remarked that Any accurate copy of a poem is as much the original work as any other Goodman Goodman was not suggesting that the distinction between poem and copy collapses If it does collapse however we have an explanation of why any accurate copy is as much the original work as any other any such copy is the same work as any other Objection Geach remarks that As for our recognizing relative identity predicables any equivalence relation can be used to specify a criterion of relative identity But above contains a counterexample Some equivalence relations are defined in terms of the I predicable of a theory and hence cannot serve as such Any pair of I predicables for a fixed theory are equivalent In fact it seems that any equivalence relation presupposes identity cf McGinn For example the relation and are the same color presupposes identity of colors since it means that there are colors and such that has and has and Identity therefore is logically prior to equivalence Reply This is a good objection It does seem to show as the objector says that identity is logically prior to ordinary similarity relations However the difference between first order and higher order relations is relevant here Traditionally similarity relations such as and are the same color have been represented in the way indicated in the objection as higher order relations involving identities between higher order objects properties Yet this treatment may not be inevitable In Deutsch an attempt is made to treat similarity relations of the form and are the same where is adjectival as primitive first order purely logical relations see also Williamson If successful a first order treatment of similarity would show that the impression that identity is prior to equivalence is merely a misimpression due to the assumption that the usual higher order account of similarity relations is the only option Objection If on day as the text asserts then by NI the same is true on day But the text also asserts that on day yet This is incoherent Reply The term is not an absolutely rigid designator and so NI does not apply Objection The notion of relative identity is incoherent If a cat and one of its proper parts are one and the same cat what is the mass of that one cat Burke Reply Young Oscar and Old Oscar are the same dog but it makes no sense to ask What is the mass of that one dog Given the possibility of change identical objects may differ in mass On the relative identity account that means that distinct logical objects that are the same may differ in mass and may differ with respect to a host of other properties as well Oscar and Oscar minus are distinct physical objects and therefore distinct logical objects Distinct physical objects may differ in mass Objection We can solve the paradox of Dalmatians by appeal to a notion of almost identity Lewis We can admit in light of the problem of the many Unger that the dog parts are dogs but we can also affirm that the dogs are not many for they are almost one Almost identity is not a relation of indiscernibility since it is not transitive and so it differs from relative identity It is a matter of negligible difference A series of negligible differences can add up to one that is not negligible Reply The difference between Oscar and Oscar minus is not negligible and the two are not almost identical Lewis concedes this point but proposes to combine almost identity with supervaluations to give a mixed solution to the paradox The supervaluation solution starts from the assumption that one and only one of the dog parts is a dog and a Dalmatian and Oscar but it doesn matter which It doesn matter which because we haven decided as much and we aren going to Since it is true that any such decision renders one and only one dog part a dog it is plain true supertrue that there is one and only one dog in the picture But it is not clear that this approach enjoys any advantage over that of relative identity in fact it seems to produce instances of RI Compare Fred bicycle has a basket attached to it Ordinarily our discourse slides over the difference between Fred bicycle with its basket attached and Fred bicycle minus the basket In this respect the case of Fred bicycle differs somewhat from that of Oscar and Oscar minus We tend not to ignore that difference In particular we don say that Fred has two bicycles even if we allow that Fred bicycle minus is a bicycle Both relative identity and supervaluations validate this intuition However both relative identity and supervaluations also affirm that Fred bicycle and Fred bicycle minus are absolutely distinct objects That is the statement that Fred bicycle and Fred bicycle minus are distinct is supertrue So the supervaluation technique affirms both that Fred bicycle and Fred bicycle minus are distinct objects and that there is one and only one relevant bicycle That is RI or close enough The supervaluation approach is not so much an alternative to relative identity as a form of it
